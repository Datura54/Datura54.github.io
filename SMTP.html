          <h2>SMTP and Email Analysis</h2>
        </header>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • See SMTP mail relay in action on your virtual machine</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Follow a normal email through two MTA servers</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Manually send a spoofed message via telnet and see how it appears in a mail client</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Examine known malicious email and identify spoofing and threats within the message content</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Lab Setup</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> docker-compose up -d </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This command will start two mail servers, one is an instance of Postfix, a very common production MTA. The
          second server is software called mailhog, which is meant for email testing and comes with its own webmail
          interface that we can use to read the mail we send. For the purposes of this lab, imagine the postfix mail
          server
          is the outgoing mail server for a legitimate company - &quot;ABC Company&quot;. The mailhog server will act as
          the
          receiving mail server for our own organization.</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p> Lab Steps</p>
        <p>
        <h5>1. Send email using Thunderbird</h5>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In this first step, we will send an email &quot;the normal way&quot; using an email client in the virtual
          machine. This email will be relayed through the postfix MTA of ABC company and sent to the receiving
          organization
          running MailHog.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Start up Thunderbird email client </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This instance of Thunderbird has been pre-configured to send email through ABC Company&#39;s postfix server
          as
          &quot;Sam A.&quot; from ABC company. Let&#39;s send an email as Sam. Click the &quot;Write&quot; button in
          Thunderbird to start crafting a new email.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-2.png"><img src="images/11-2.png"
              alt="images/11-2.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Fill in student@sec450.com as the &quot;To:&quot; address, and add a quick subject of &quot;Hello&quot; and
          some
          email text.</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-3.png"><img src="images/11-3.png"
              alt="images/11-3.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Once finished, hit the Send button.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Let&#39;s see how the headers look and how the details of the mail client&#39;s interaction with the postfix
          server of ABC Company show up in the email source.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Open up the MailHog webmail interface where we can read the email we just sent as the receiving
          organization.
          In
          my case we will go to <a href="http://localhost:8025/">http://localhost:8025</a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> There it is! Click on it to open it up.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-4.png"><img src="images/11-4.png"
              alt="images/11-4.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Here we can see the details of the mail sent. Click on the show headers button so see the details.</p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-5.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> There&#39;s a lot of interesting data in the header that can help us understand how an email is constructed.
          First things first, let&#39;s look at the path the email took.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-6.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Highlighted in the screenshot, #1 is the first step the email took from the Thunderbird client to ABC
          Company&#39;s postfix server. Note that the actual IP address the email was received from (172.22.0.1) was
          recorded in headers, as well as what the mail client identified itself as (127.0.0.1), you can also see the
          mail
          server&#39;s hostname (smtp.abc-company.com) and software (Postfix). The line also include a unique ID for the
          email transaction, as well as a timestamp.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In #2 in the screenshot, there is the second step the email took from the sending organizations MTA to the
          receiving MailHog MTA. Many of the same details are present in this header, but it is formatted a little bit
          differently. Each email server writes received lines in his own way, and this email is a good example of that.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Looking at the rest of the detail in the header gives us a lot of other information we can use to track how
          the
          email was sent. The User-Agent header is present, which can tell us that the sender (can be faked) used
          Thunderbird to send the mail. There are other bits of metadata as well like the Return-Path, MIME types, and
          encoding that is used. Where does all of this information come from?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> If we want to deeply understand where email headers come from, inspecting the PCAP of this email being sent
          can
          give us that information. The following screenshot was made by sending the same email and capturing it in
          Wireshark as it went from Thunderbird to Postfix.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-7.png"><img src="images/11-7.png"
              alt="images/11-7.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In this picture we can see the actual transaction that Thunderbird made with the mail server (Thunderbird is
          in
          red, Postfix responses are in blue), starting with identifying itself as 127.0.0.1 in the beginning with the
          &quot;EHLO&quot; command, and ending with the &quot;QUIT&quot; command at the end. One of the items to notice
          is
          that the To and From address is entered twice, this shows (highlighted with arrows). When spammers want to
          send
          email and change how it appears, this is the point at which they can enter two different values, DMARC is the
          standard that looks for these two items to be aligned. If we want to try this, it&#39;s possible to use telnet
          to
          manually craft a message, typing out every field yourself.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-8.png"><img src="images/11-8.png"
              alt="images/11-8.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> How will this email look in MailHog? Here&#39;s what happens:</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-9.png"><img src="images/11-9.png"
              alt="images/11-9.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> And what about the details of the email? Looking at the headers, this is where we can see that something is
          wrong. The email claims to be from tesla.com, but the headers all seem to point to it coming from
          abc-company.com&#39;s infrastructure, the return path also goes back to the email used in the envelope headers
          as
          well. This is one way you can potentially identify attempts to confused spam recipients.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-10.png"><img src="images/11-10.png"
              alt="images/11-10.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This is how spammers can easily relabel their emails, taking advantage of how the receiving email client
          renders
          the two different To: fields.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This is not just a side-effect of using MailHog, if you download the email from MailHog and open it in
          Thunderbird, the same thing is displayed - no mention of the true sender, sam@abc-company.com, is here at all
          unless you view the source.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-11.png"><img src="images/11-11.png"
              alt="images/11-11.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Let&#39;s dig deeper into the transaction and headers of the original email. If we do a side-by-side
          comparison
          of the PCAP and the actual received email, we can see where many of the other fields are sourced. In the
          following
          picture, items from the emails &quot;envelope&quot; are pointed out in green, while items from the data
          section
          are pointed out in red.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-12.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> While the MAIL FROM: and RCPT TO: command values make an appearance in the headers in the Return-Path field
          and
          in the Received trace header respectively. As we saw with the Elon Musk email example, it is the To: and From:
          lines in the DATA section of the email that are used by the mail client to display to the recipient.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Looking through the rest of the transaction from Thunderbird, it turns out many of the fields in the email
          envelope and data section are sourced directly from the information the sending email client (Thunderbird)
          enters
          as it talks to the Postfix server. It is hard to set all of this straight when looking at email samples, but
          when
          done this way, the relationship becomes much more clear.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Now that we&#39;ve seen how these transactions work when done in the &quot;normal&quot; way let&#39;s send a
          completely spoofed email on our own using telnet!</p>
        <p>
        <h5>2. Spoof an email from the command line</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> While most email sent legitimately will be sourced from another organizations email server, spammers can
          talk
          directly to your inbound mail server as well. Though attackers could spam you using &quot;legitimate&quot; yet
          hacked email accounts, talking directly to your servers allows them to send spam email without involving a
          stolen
          account. It also unbounds them from the safeguards that would otherwise put up a roadblock to sending spoofed
          messages through a real outbound mail server.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In this step we&#39;ll send a fake email by directly communicating with the inbound MailHog server in the
          way
          that an attacker trying to spoof email to our organization might attempt.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Use the following commands to connect to the local email server and send an email from the command line</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> telnet localhost 25</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Once this command connects you should receive the response below indicating you&#39;re talking to the
          MailHog
          server:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-13.png"><img src="images/11-13.png"
              alt="images/11-13.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Type the following into the terminal one line at a time, pressing Enter after each line.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> EHLO microsoft.com</p>
        <p> MAIL FROM:&lt;bill.gates@microsoft.com&gt;</p>
        <p> RCPT TO:&lt;student@sec450.localhost&gt;</p>
        <p> DATA</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> These lines must then be entered, but this time you can copy them all to the clipboard and paste them all at
          once (do not miss the blank lines and the &quot;.&quot; at the end):</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> To: student@sec450.com</p>
        <p> From: Bill Gates &lt;bill.gates@microsoft.com&gt;</p>
        <p> Subject: Hello</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Good afternoon, this is a message from Bill himself!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> .</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> After the &quot;.&quot; on the last line, which is crucial to not miss because it is how you tell the server
          you&#39;ve done entering the message, hit Enter. You should see 250 Ok: queued as ... returned from the
          server.
          Finally, type the following to disconnect from the server:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> QUIT</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> As you type, the server should be responding with messages like the ones highlighted in the photo below. If
          you
          accidentally make a typo, you can try the single erroneous command again, or type &quot;QUIT&quot; to exit and
          retry the whole transaction.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> The entire interaction should have looked like the picture below.</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-14.png"><img src="images/11-14.png"
              alt="images/11-14.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Once you&#39;ve typed &quot;QUIT&quot; and disconnected, go back to MailHog inbox and press the refresh
          button,
          you should now see your spoofed email!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-15.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> Click on the email and once inside, click the &quot;Show headers button again&quot;. Look what we have now!
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-16.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> It&#39;s this easy! We have just manually sent a spoofed email from the command line! As we saw in the
          previous
          step, when sending an email in the normal way using a mail client, the mail client itself is just taking the
          information you&#39;ve entered into the program and performing this transaction for you. Although it may seem
          otherwise, email is actually very basic!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Out of curiosity, this is what the pcap looks like in Wireshark</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-17.png"><img src="images/11-17.png"
              alt="images/11-17.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This simple demonstration highlights that email verification is purely the job of your email server, because
          you
          can&#39;t trust anything upstream to handle that for you. In this case, MailHog is not doing any verification
          to
          ensure that the email actually came from Microsoft&#39;s servers. It doesn&#39;t do SPF checks, DKIM, or
          DMARC,
          just dutifully passes email on without questioning it. Your infrastructure will do this too if you don&#39;t
          take
          any measures to stop it! This means without SPF, DKIM, or any other checks, attackers from outside the network
          could do exactly what we did here and spoof email to your employees, even pretending to come from your own
          domain!
          You&#39;ve now seen how easy it is!</p>
        <p>
        <h5>3. Analyze headers from a real spam email</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Now it&#39;s time to look at the real thing. Let&#39;s pretend a user has forwarded you an email as a
          reported
          phishing attempt. An .eml file is simply the plain text version of an email, headers, content, and all, and
          can
          be
          opened with any text editor or rendered in Thunderbird.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> For this email we will attempt to determine the answers to a few questions:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • What was the intent of the email?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Where did the email originate - a hacked account, an account made for spamming, or was it spoofed?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • What is the apparent IP address of the sender and what was the last known verifiable IP of where the email
          came from before it was submitted to GMail&#39;s servers?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Let&#39;s first look at the email with Thunderbird and try to answer question #1. We&#39;ll use Thunderbird
          because this is an HTML based email and trying to read the content with a text editor will be too complex. We
          will
          use the following command to open up the email.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> thunderbird /labs/2.3/spam.eml</p>

        <p> When we over the links, you will find they are shortened with Bit.ly so that we cannot see the true final
          destination. Thunderbird also warns us the email tries to load remote pictures (likely an attempt at tracking
          open
          rates). To find where shortened links go, for bit.ly at least, adding a &quot;+&quot; to the end of the URL
          will
          allow you to see a special preview page for any link. If you want to test this yourself be sure to use the URL
          &quot;<a href="https://bitly.com/2uEOaBn+">https://bitly.com/2uEOaBn+</a>&quot;!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Using the above method with link from the email shows the following Bit.ly preview page and the domain the
          spam
          attempts to take you to, regardless of which of the 3 links the user clicked:</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-19.png"><img src="images/11-19.png"
              alt="images/11-19.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> Interestingly, through this method, you can also see how many people did click the link looking to buy
          health
          supplements from strangers on the internet. We can do this because the preview page includes an activity count
          for
          the shortened URL. :)</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Bit.ly also tells us the link has been flagged as either malicious or spam content. If you were to follow
          the
          link, the page it loads looks like this (Classic):</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-20.png"><img src="images/11-20.png"
              alt="images/11-20.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Since we have seen this email seems to redirect you to diet supplements, and not to a malicious document or
          other file download, we can answer question <strong>1. This is probably regular, not particularly malicious
            spam.</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Back to the email details to answer the other questions, let&#39;s open up the .eml file with a text editor
          to
          take a look at the headers. Type the following command at a terminal to open up Microsoft Visual Studio Code
          to
          read the .eml file.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> code /labs/2.3/spam.eml</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Lines 1-49 of the .eml file contain the trace headers as expected (of which there are many). Remember that
          chronologically the first received headers that were generated are at the bottom starting with line 49.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-21.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> From the trace headers we can learn a few things about where the email came from. On line 49 we have the
          very
          first header that was added:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-22.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> On line 29-32, we have a received topmost trace header where the email left the sending infrastructure and
          was
          received by mx.google.com. We&#39;re interested in this because it contains the last known true IP, anything
          on
          higher numbered lines could be faked. In this case, we can confidently say the email came to GMail&#39;s
          servers
          from the host at IP 52.42.193.106.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> There&#39;s an interesting twist here though, look at lines 39-43, there seems to be a second line saying
          the
          email was received by mx.google.com. Which one is correct?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-23.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> To figure this out, look at the highlighted information in the line 39-43 entry. Not only is the received
          line
          absent of any IP addresses, it also mentions the unresolvable hostname 01.377yelp. The higher up header has
          the
          correct formatting, a real hostname, and an IP address. Not only that, the lower received header claims the
          email
          was received on 13 Feb! This spam email was actually received 29 March, as shown in the higher header.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Although it&#39;s hard to say with absolute certainty, it very much seems that this is a spoofed email
          header
          meant to throw spam filtering off the trail. We know mx.google.com can&#39;t receive the email twice, so one
          of
          them must be wrong. Given that headers are written from the bottom up and the fact that the header is so odd,
          the
          lower one is highly likely to be faked (as well as all other information below the correct received header).
        </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-24.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> What that means is the best we can say is that the email came from IP 52.42.193.106, which claimed to (on
          the
          &quot;EHLO&quot; line in the SMTP connection) be the domain adlexhi.press. When Google resolved the IP with a
          PTR
          record request it pointed to ec2-52-42-193-106.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com - likely an Amazon AWS instance
          used transiently for sending spam.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> We can verify this by checking this domain on the Spamhaus DBL (domain block list) - indeed, at the time of
          this
          writing the domain is listed:</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-25.png"><img src="images/11-25.png"
              alt="images/11-25.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> What about the SPF check, why did it say &quot;pass&quot; if the email was spoofed?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-26.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> First, although it was an spf &quot;pass&quot;, the verbiage says it was a &quot;best guess record&quot;
          which
          means the specific subdomain the email claimed to be from did not have an SPF record, so it fell back to using
          the
          top level domain. What domain did the email claim to be from though? Remember previously when we typed the
          MAIL
          FROM: line upon the initial SMTP connection (the &quot;envelope from&quot; address)? How SMTP works is
          whatever
          address was entered there gets filled into the Return-Path header, and the Return-Path header is the domain
          SPF
          uses for verification. Therefore in this email we can see the return path (and MAIL FROM:) entered was
          FDNJWdHw@fdnjwdhw----------------------.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com. Since this domain doesn&#39;t exist,
          it
          can&#39;t have its own SPF record, so google fell back to checking amazonaws.com&#39;s SPF record. Here&#39;s
          the
          response it would&#39;ve received and used to judge the email:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-27.png"><img src="images/11-27.png"
              alt="images/11-27.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Since there is a ~all in this record, the spf check technically passed, just in the most minimal way
          possible,
          and using a domain that wasn&#39;t real.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Moving on to the message headers on lines 50-65, is there anything else that stands out?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/11-28.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> There are a lot of optional &quot;X-&quot; headers that seem to contain useful information here, but the
          &quot;From:&quot; and &quot;Date:&quot; lines do stick out. For one, the date header is listed here as Feb
          13th
          again. Second, the From: address is set to claim the email is from the domain cclyelp.com. If we check the
          details
          on this domain with the whois command, we&#39;ll find that domain doesn&#39;t actually exist!</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-29.png"><img src="images/11-29.png"

        <p> As you can see, email header analysis is not always straight foward and you never know what you&#39;re going
          to
          find. Although it&#39;s not always 100% possible to know what happened in an emails past, looking for the
          basic
          fields we have discussed can give us a clue to the origins, and whether it is likely to be malicious or not.

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> The goal in of this lab is to get you deep down into the details of how email is sent. Without a full
          understanding of where the fields in the headers come from, how email is transacted from client to server, and
          sending server to receiving server, it&#39;s hard to make sense of what is real email and what is spoofed.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Strong monitoring of email with a tool like Suricata can help you track down and eliminate spam waves as
          they
          come in. When applied to the email in this lab, Suricata produces the following log:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/19-30.png"><img src="images/11-30.png"
              alt="images/11-30.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Notice it includes both from addresses, as well as an MD5 hash of the subject, which makes it easy to
          search.
          With the ability to group and search incoming email fields in your SIEM, once an email is identified as
          potentially malicious, finding and scoping the problem becomes much easier. Hopefully this lab helped you
          understand how email is crafted and sent, and will assist you in email alert triage going forward!</p>

        <h5>In this lab, we have:</h5>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Sent an email through a simulated two-server email system</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Analyzed email headers to see where each field comes from</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Analyzed a PCAP of an email being sent from a client to server</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Manually crafted and sent a spoofed email</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Analyzed a real spam email to understand where it came from and find the goal of the attack</p>
