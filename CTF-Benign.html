            <h3>Scenario Notes:</h3>
            • A host from the HR department has been identified as potentially compromised based on suspicious
            process execution alerts from the IDS.<br>
            • Further investigation using network information-gathering tools
            and scheduled tasks revealed activities that confirmed the suspicion of a compromised host within the HR
            department.<br>
            • The investigation was constrained by limited resources, leading to the extraction of
            process execution logs with Event ID 4688, which were ingested into Splunk for analysis.<br>
            • The network is
            divided into three segments - IT Department, HR Department, and Marketing Department. Understanding this
            segmentation could help in narrowing down the scope of the investigation and identifying potential attack
            vectors.<strong>
              <h3>Objective:</h3>
            </strong>Identify the root cause of a network connectivity issue for a specific workstation in the IT
            department.<strong>
              <h3>Question 1:</h3>
            </strong>How many logs are ingested from the month of March, 2022?<strong>
              <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            </strong><a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/34-1.png" alt="images/34-1.png" /></a><a
              href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/34-2.png" alt="images/34-2.png" /></a><strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>13959<strong>
              <h3>Question 2:</h3>
            </strong>Imposter Alert: There seems to be an imposter account observed in the logs, what is the name of
            that
            user? <strong>
              <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            </strong>By querying the database for the top 20 &quot;Username&quot; entries, it becomes evident that
            further
            investigation of the account named &quot;Amel1a&quot; is warranted. Intriguingly, the creator chose
            to
            name
            it &quot;Amel1a&quot; while there is another account with the name &quot;Amelia.&quot; This coincidence
            raises
            interesting points for consideration.<a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/34-3.png"
                  alt="images/34-3.png" /></a><strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>Amel1a<strong>
              <h3>Question 3:</h3>
            </strong>Which user from the HR department was observed to be running scheduled tasks?<strong>
              <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            </strong>On this next query we will ask for every user that is in the HR department and ran a process
            named
            schtasks.exe<a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/34-4.png" alt="images/34-4.png" /></a>There
            were 18
            events but after a bit of scrolling this event was the only one that run a scheduled task, the other
            ones
            are updates<a href=""><img src="images/34-5.png" alt="images/34-5.png" /></a><strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>Chris.fort<strong>
              <h3>Question 4:</h3>
            </strong>Which user from the HR department executed a system process (LOLBIN) to download a payload from a
            file-sharing host.<strong>
              <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            </strong>Let&#39;s apply the same query logic as the last question but now let&#39;s run the command
            &quot;stats&quot;, in Splunk, it counts occurrences of each unique value in the &quot;CommandLine&quot;
            field
            and
            then display the results.<a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/34-6.png"
                  alt="images/34-6.png" /></a>Let&#39;s further
            investigate the first result as It appears that the
            command uses &quot;certutil.exe&quot; to download a file from a specific URL (&quot;<a
              href="https://controlc.com/548ab556">https://controlc.com/548ab556</a>&quot;) and save it as
            &quot;benign.exe&quot; in the local directory. Meaning this command can be used to download a file from the
            Internet
            and store it on your computer.<a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/34-7.png"
                  alt="images/34-7.png" /></a>Now we will
            change the format a bit because just in this print we have
            the answer for 6 questions and the answers are self-explanatory <strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>haroon<strong>
              <h3>Question 5:</h3>
            </strong>To bypass the security controls, which system process (lolbin) was used to download a payload from
            the internet?<strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>certutil.exe<strong>
              <h3>Question 6:</h3>
            </strong>What was the date that this binary was executed by the infected host? format
            (YYYY-MM-DD)<strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>2022-03-04<strong>
              <h3>Question 7:</h3>
            </strong>Which third-party site was accessed to download the malicious payload?<strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>controlc.com<strong>
              <h3>Question 8:</h3>
            </strong>What is the name of the file that was saved on the host machine from the C2 server during the
            post-exploitation phase?<strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>benign.exe<strong>
              <h3>Question 9:</h3>
            </strong>The suspicious file downloaded from the C2 server contained malicious content with the pattern
            THM{..........}; what is that pattern?<strong>
              <h3>Explanation:</h3>
            </strong>To see the content from where the malicious content was downloaded, we have to go into the
            website itself <a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/34-8.png"
                  alt="images/34-8.png" /></a><strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>C:\\Users\\Finance01\\AppData\\Roaming\\EasyCalc\\EasyCalc.exe<strong>
              <h3>Question 10:</h3>
            </strong>What is the URL that the infected host is connected to?<strong>
              <h3>Answer:</h3>
            </strong>hxxps://controlc.com/548ab556<strong>
              <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
              In this investigation, suspicious activities on a compromised host in the HR department were analyzed.
              Limited resources necessitated focusing on Event ID 4688 logs in Splunk. The investigation revealed an
              imposter account, scheduled tasks run by a user named "Chris.fort," execution of LOLBIN "certutil.exe" to
              download a payload from controlc.com, and other related details. The date, filename, content pattern, and
              URL associated with the malicious payload was also identified, aiding in understanding the nature of the
              compromise.<br><br>
            </strong>1. A total of 13,959 logs were ingested from March 2022, providing a comprehensive
            dataset for analysis.<br><br>
            2. An imposter account named &quot;Amel1a&quot; was observed in the logs, raising
            concerns about potential unauthorized access.<br><br>
            3. The user &quot;Chris.fort&quot; from the HR department
            was observed running scheduled tasks, warranting further investigation into their activities.<br><br>
            4. The user
            &quot;haroon&quot; from the HR department executed the system process &quot;certutil.exe&quot; to download a
            payload
            from the URL &quot;<a href="https://controlc.com/548ab556">https://controlc.com/548ab556</a>,&quot; saving
            it
            as
            &quot;benign.exe&quot; in the local directory. This allowed the attacker to bypass security controls and
            initiate
            the download of a malicious payload.<br><br>
            5. To bypass security controls, the attacker used the system process
            &quot;certutil.exe&quot; to download the payload from the internet.<br><br>
            6. The execution date of the
            malicious binary was on March 4, 2022.<br><br>
            7. The third-party site &quot;controlc.com&quot; was accessed to
            download the malicious payload.<br><br>
            8. The file saved on the host machine from the C2 server during the
            the post-exploitation phase was named &quot;benign.exe.&quot;<br><br>
            9. The malicious content in the downloaded file
            had the pattern &quot;THM{..........},&quot; indicating the presence of a threat or malware.<br><br>
            10. The URL
            that the infected host connected to was &quot;hxxps://controlc.com/548ab556,&quot; confirming the source of
            the
            malicious payload.
