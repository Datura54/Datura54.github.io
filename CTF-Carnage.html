            <h3>Scenario Notes:</h3>
          </strong>• Eric Fischer from Bartell Ltd's Purchasing Department opened a Word document received via email and
          clicked on "Enable Content."<br>
          • As a result of clicking on "Enable Content," Eric's workstation initiated suspicious outbound connections,
          triggering an alert from the SOC (Security Operations Center) department.<br>
          • The SOC department retrieved a packet capture (pcap) from the network sensor to analyze the nature and scope
          of the suspicious connections.<br>
          • The pcap analysis will focus on identifying the source, destination, and purpose of the outbound
          connections,
          as well as potential indicators of compromise and any malicious activities associated with the
          incident.<strong><br>
            <h3>Objective:</h3>
          </strong> Investigate the packet capture and uncover the malicious activities.<strong>
            <h3>Question 1:</h3>
          </strong>What was the date and time for the first HTTP connection to the malicious IP?
          (<strong>answer format</strong>: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss)<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>First we will query wireshark for every http connection, and then we can investigate when was the
          first
          target by two ways, either by organizing the packets in cornological order or assume that the first
          connecction
          made is a connection that will download the malware so the connection has to be made with the GET
          command<a><span class="image fit"><img src="images/35-1.png" alt="images/35-1.png" /></a><strong>

            <h3>Question 4:</h3>
          </strong>Without downloading the file, what is the name of the file in the zip file?<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>To find the file we have to inspect the traffic<br> <a><span class="image fit"><img
                src="images/35-4.png" alt="images/35-4.png" /></a>The archived file is right on top<br> <a><span

            <h3>Question 5:</h3>
          </strong>What is the name of the webserver of the malicious IP from which the zip file was
          downloaded?<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>While inspecting the traffic we can also check the name of the webserver<a><span

            <h3>Question 7:</h3>
          </strong>Malicious files were downloaded to the victim host from multiple domains. What were the
          three<strong> </strong>domains involved with this activity?<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>To find the domains it seems logicall to look for DNS traffic, so we will query wireshark for every
          DNS connection and also will make the name of domains as part of the collums <a><span class="image fit"><img
                src="images/35-8.png" alt="images/35-8.png" /></a>Well i know Microsoft is sketchy by it self but
          making a direct connetion with &quot;finejewels.com.au&quot; at the login seems to be too mutch<a><span

            <h3>Question 8:</h3>
          </strong>Which certificate authority issued the SSL certificate to the first domain from the previous
          question?<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>In order for the SSL Certificate be issued he has to be connected the SSL/TLS protocol, so we will
          search for the protocol in wireshar and format the view to “Resolve Nertwork Addresses”<a><span
              class="image fit"><img src="images/35-10.png" alt="images/35-10.png" /></a>After that we just have to find
          the domain we
          want to investigate and Follow → TCP <a><span class="image fit"><img src="images/35-11.png"

            <h3>Question 9:</h3>
          </strong>What are the two IP addresses of the Cobalt Strike servers? Use VirusTotal (the Community tab) to
          confirm if IPs are identified as Cobalt Strike C2 servers. (answer format: enter the IP addresses in
          sequential
          order)<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>In this question I invested a lot of time in research and found a lot of possible ways to find but
          only a few did work, and the one that makes more sense for is first search for uncommon activity in
          semi-common
          ports, On MITRE ATT&amp;CK they explainned it better
          <a><span class="image fit"><img src="images/35-12.png" alt="images/35-12.png" /></span></a>
          By my research, it is known that C2 connections are usually made by TCP on port 8080 and as soon as I query
          that
          onto Wireshark one particular IP Address catches my attention
          <a><span class="image fit"><img src="images/35-13.png" alt="images/35-13.png" /></a>Why is the 185.125.204.174
          and not the
          10.9.233.102 that catches my attention? Because that&#39;s “us”. If you look at the first print i took in this
          CTF
          you will see that this same IP Address is the one that made the GET request to download the documents.zip. So
          let&#39;s go to VirusTotal to confirm our suspicions <a><span class="image fit"><img src="images/35-14.png"
                alt="images/35-14.png" /></span></a>One is done. Now the second best option to
          find
          another C2 is on port 80.
          <a><span class="image fit"><img src="images/35-15.png" alt="images/35-15.png" /></a>On the
          next print there are two candidates, but for sure the “185.106.96.158” wins, why? Because out of nowhere this
          happened <a><span class="image fit"><img src="images/35-16.png" alt="images/35-16.png" /></a>The ammount of
          bytes had a
          change going complilty out of the normal, making it my best guess<a><span class="image fit"><img
                src="images/35-17.png" alt="images/35-17.png" /></span></a><strong>

            <h3>Question 10:</h3>
          </strong>What is the Host header for the first Cobalt Strike IP address from the previous
          question?<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>This one is straight forward, just go to one packet with “185.106.96.158” and Follow → TCP

            <h3>Question 10:</h3>
          </strong>What is the domain name for the first IP address of the Cobalt Strike server? You may use VirusTotal
          to confirm if it&#39;s the Cobalt Strike server (check the Community tab).<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>My first tough was to do a reserve DNS lookup but that did not work so we will just query the
          Wireshark for the derised IP and then change our view to give us not the IP but his Domain associated <a><span
              class="image fit"><img src="images/35-19.png" alt="images/35-19.png" /></a><a><span class="image fit"><img

          “185.106.96.158” is “survmeter.live”<strong>

          it&#39;s the Cobalt Strike server (check the Community tab).<strong>

            <h3>Explanation:</h3>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            In this scenario, we were tasked with investigating suspicious activities triggered by the opening of a Word
            document with enabled content on Eric Fischer's workstation at Bartell Ltd. The subsequent outbound
            connections led us to analyze a packet capture (pcap) to uncover the nature and extent of the malicious
            activities. Our investigation aimed to identify the source, destination, purpose of the outbound
            connections,
            indicators of compromise, and potential malicious actions associated with the incident.<br><br>

            1. We pinpointed the initial HTTP connection to the malicious IP, identifying the date and time as
            2021-09-24
            16:44:38.<br><br>

            2. The malicious Word document led to the download of a zip file named documents.zip.<br><br>

            3. The attirenepal.com domain hosted the malicious zip file.<br><br>

            4. Analyzing the zip file, we discovered a file named chart-1530076591.xls.<br><br>

            5. The litespeed webserver hosted the malicious content for download.<br><br>

            6. The webserver version was PHP/7.2.34.<br><br>

            7. The malicious files were downloaded from the domains finejewels.com.au, thietbiagt.com, and
            new.americold.com.<br><br>

            8. The SSL certificate for the first domain was issued by GoDaddy.<br><br>

            9. We identified two Cobalt Strike servers with IP addresses 185.125.204.174 and 185.106.96.158. We verified
            their status as Cobalt Strike C2 servers using VirusTotal.<br><br>

            10. The Host header for the first Cobalt Strike IP address was ocsp.verisign.com.<br><br>
