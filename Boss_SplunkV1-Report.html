            <h3>Executive summary</h3>
          </strong></p>
          <p> The organization experienced a security incident on December 28, 2022, at 7:20 p.m., PT, during which
            an individual was able to deface the company website. Approximately 50,000 customer records were affected.
            The financial impact of the incident is estimated to be $100,000 in direct costs and potential loss of
            revenue. The incident is
            now closed and a thorough investigation has been conducted.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
          <h3> </h3><strong>

            <h3>Investigation</h3>
          </strong></p>
          <p> The root cause of the incident was identified as a brute-force attack. This attack enabled the attacker to
            gain full control of our server, exploiting a vulnerability that provided access to all the information
            stored on the server, including customer purchase confirmation pages, customer data, and more.<br>

            After confirming the web application vulnerability, the security team analyzed the web application access
            logs. The logs indicated that the attacker downloaded an image and completely blocked the usage of the
            server.</p>

          <p>
          <h3> </h3><strong>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          </strong></p>

          <ul>
            <li> Implement the following access control mechanisms:</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li> Block any connection starting from the server with the firewall.
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li> Ensure that users have a limit on the number of login password attempts.
              </li>
            </ul>








            <br><br>
            <h2>Cyber Kill Chain:</h2>
            We have investigated a cyber-attack where the attacker had defaced a website
            &#39;<strong>imreallynotbatman.com</strong>&#39; of the Wayne Enterprise. We mapped the attacker&#39;s
            activities
            into the <strong>7 phases of the Cyber Kill Chain</strong>. Let us recap everything we have found so
            far:<br /><br /><strong>
              <h3>Reconnaissance Phase:</h3>

              We first looked at any reconnaissance activity from the attacker to identify the IP address and other
              details
              about the adversary.<br /><strong>
                Findings:<br>
                • IP Address <strong>40.80.148.42</strong> was found to be scanning our webserver.<br />• The
                attacker was using Acunetix as a web scanner.<br /><br /><strong>
                  <h3>Weaponization Phase:</h3>

                  We used various threat Intel platforms to find the attacker&#39;s infrastructure based
                  on the
                  following
                  information we saw in the above activities.
                  <br>Information we had:<br />• Domain: 
                  <strong>prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com•
                    IP Address: <strong>23.22.63.114<br />Findings:<br>
                      • Multiple masquerading domains were found associated with the attacker&#39;s
                      IPs.<br />•
                      An
                      email of
                      the user <strong>Lillian.rose@po1s0n1vy.com</strong> was also found associated with
                      the attacker&#39;s
                      IP
                      address.<br /><br /><strong>
                        <h3>Deliver Phase:</h3>

                        In this phase, we again leveraged online Threat Intel sites to find malware
                        associated with the
                        adversary&#39;s
                        IP address, which appeared to be a secondary attack vector if the initial
                        compromise failed.
                        <br /><strong>
                          Findings:<br>
                          • A malware name <strong>MirandaTateScreensaver.scr.exe</strong> was found
                          associated
                          with
                          the
                          adversary.<br />• MD5 of the malware
                          was <strong>c99131e0169171935c5ac32615ed6261<br />
                            <h3>Exploitation Phase:</h3>
                            We then looked into the traces of exploitation attempts and found brute-force attacks
                            against
                            our
                            server, which were successful.</h3><br /><strong>
                              Findings:<br>
                              • Brute force attack originated from IP <strong>23.22.63.114</strong>.<br />• The IP
                              address
                              used to
                              gain access: <strong>40.80.148.42• 142 unique brute force attempts were made against
                                the
                                server, out
                                of which one attempt was successful<br /><br /><strong>
                                  <h3>Installation Phase:</h3>

                                  Next, we looked at the installation phase to see any executable from the
                                  attacker&#39;s
                                  IP
                                  Address
                                  uploaded to
                                  our server.
                                  <br>Findings:<br>
                                  • A malicious executable file <strong>3791.exe</strong> was observed to be
                                  uploaded
                                  by
                                  the
                                  attacker.<br />• We looked at the sysmon logs and found the MD5 hash of the
                                  file.<br /><br /><strong>

                                    <h3>Command and Control:</h3>

                                    We have identified the suspicious domain as a Command and Control Server, which
                                    the attacker contacted
                                    after
                                    gaining control of the server.<strong>
                                      <br>Findings:<br>
                                      • This attack used dynamic DNS to resolve to the malicious IP. <br />• Fully
                                      qualified
                                      domain
                                      name
                                      (FQDN): prankglassinebracket.jumpingcrab.com.<br /><br /><strong>

                                        <h3>Action on Objective:</h3>

                                        After compromising the web server, the attacker defaced the website.<br>
                                        Findings:<br>
                                        • We examined the logs and found the file name used to deface the
                                        webserver “/poisonivy-is-coming-for-you-batman.jpeg”.<br /><br /><strong>
