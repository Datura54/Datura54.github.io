            Reconnaissance is an
            attempt to
            discover and collect information about a target. It could be knowledge about the system in use, the web
            application,
            employees or location, etc.<br /><br />We will start our analysis by examining any reconnaissance attempt
            against
            the webserver imreallynotbatman.com. From an analyst perspective, where do we first need to look? If we look
            at the
            available log sources, we will find some log sources covering the network traffic, which means all the
            inbound
            communication towards our web server will be logged into the log source that contains the web traffic.
            Let&#39;s
            start by searching for the domain in the search head and see which log source includes the traces of our
            domain.<br /><strong>
              <h3>Search Query:</h3>
              <div class="codebox">
                <pre><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400">index</span>=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com</pre>
              </div>
              <h3> </h3>We are going to look for the event logs in the <strong>index &quot;botsv1&quot;</strong> which
              contains
              the term <strong>imreallynotbatman.com</strong><br /><br /><a href=""><span class="image fit"><img
                    src="images/52-2.png" alt="images/52-2.png" /></a><br /><br />Here we have searched for the
              term <strong>imreallynotbatman.com</strong> in the <strong>index &quot;botsv1&quot;</strong>. In
              the sourcetype field, we saw that the following log sources contain the traces of this search term.<br />•
              Suricata<br />• stream:http<br />• fortigate_utm<br />• iis<br /><br />From the name of these log sources,
              it
              is
              clear what each log source may contain. Every analyst may have a different approach to investigating a
              scenario. Our
              first task is to identify the IP address attempting to perform reconnaissance activity on our web server.
              It
              would
              be obvious to look at the web traffic coming into the network. We can start looking into any of the logs
              mentioned
              above sources.<br />Let us begin looking at the log source stream:http, which contains the http traffic
              logs,
              and
              examine the src_ip field from the left panel. Src_ip field contains the source IP address it finds in the
              logs.<br /><br />

                  So far, we have found two IPs in the src_ip
                  field <strong>40.80.148.42</strong> and <strong>23.22.63.114</strong>. The first IP seems to contain a
                  high
                  percentage of the logs as compared to the other IP, which could be the answer. Being eficient with my
                  time
                  is
                  also
                  part of the job so we will attack the most probable malicious IP Address.<br />To further confirm our
                  suspicion
                  about the IP address <strong>40.80.148.42</strong>, click on the IP and examine the logs. We can look
                  at
                  the
                  interesting fields like User-Agent, Post request, URIs, etc., to see what kind of traffic is coming
                  from
                  this
                  particular IP.<br /><br />

                          alt="images/52-4.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />After conducting some
                    research, I
                    discovered that this particular IP address is generating a significant number of HTTP 303 errors.
                    The
                    HTTP
                    303
                    status code is a response code that signals the requested resource has been replaced with a
                    different
                    one.
                    This code
                    is frequently employed to redirect a client to an alternate URL or resource, often in response to a
                    POST
                    request.</br>
                    Meaning, It&#39;s possible that an IP address generating a significant number of 303 HTTP responses
                    could
                    be
                    engaged
                    in reconnaissance activities. Reconnaissance is a common phase in the cyber attack lifecycle
                    where
                    attackers
                    gather information about a target to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan their next
                    steps.<br /><br /><strong>

                    </strong><strong><br /></strong><br />So what do we need to do to validate the scanning attempt? We
                    can
                    leverage
                    <strong>Suricata</strong> <strong>logs</strong>, and see if any rule is triggered on this
                    communication.<br /><strong>

                      let&#39;s
                      take this step by step. So what do we do? We collect more information.<br /><br />First, based on
                      the
                      information
                      provided above, we are aware that a network scan has been detected. Therefore, our next step is to
                      determine
                      the
                      type of scanner that was utilized.<br /><a href=""><span class="image fit"><img
                            src="images/52-6.png" alt="images/52-6.png" /></a><br /><br />“Acunetix” is an automated web
                      application security testing
                      tool
                      that audits your web applications by checking for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross site

                      other
                      exploitable vulnerabilities.<br /><br />From the “signature” field we get to know what
                      vulnerability
                      did
                      the
                      attacker attempted to exploit.<br /><a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/52-7.png"

                          class="image fit"><img src="images/52-8.png" alt="images/52-8.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />To
                      obtain a more comprehensive view, we need to identify
                      the
                      IP
                      address of our server and determine the Content Management System (CMS) it is using.<br /><br />By
                      utilizing
                      Splunk&#39;s fields, we can efficiently identify the IP addresses that the attacker attempted to
                      connect
                      to,
                      which
                      will provide us with the IP address of the server. <br /><br /><a href=""><span
                          class="image fit"><img src="images/52-9.png" alt="images/52-9.png" /></a><br /><br />Now, for
                      content management systems (CMS), we can examine the
                      HTTP
                      requests made by the attacker, and we should be able to locate it.<br /><br /><a href=""><span

                      We first looked at any reconnaissance activity from the attacker to identify the IP address and
                      other
                      details
                      about the adversary<br /><strong>
