            We will investigate a cyber attack in which the attacker defaced an organization&#39;s
            website. This
            organization has Splunk as a SIEM solution setup. Our task as a Security Analysis would be to investigate
            this cyber
            attack and map the attacker&#39;s activities into all 7 of the Cyber Kill Chain Phases. It is important to
            note that
            we don&#39;t need to follow the sequence of the cyber kill chain during the Investigation. One finding in
            one phase
            will lead to another finding that may have mapped into some other phase.<br /><br /><a href=""><span

                  alt="images/49-3.png" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br />We will
            follow the Cyber kill
            Chain
            Model and map the attacker&#39;s activity in each phase during this Investigation. When required, we will
            also
            utilize Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and other findings to fill the gaps in the kill chain.<br /><br />
            <h2>Scenario</h2>
          </strong><br />
          A Big corporate organization
          Wayne Enterprises
        </strong>
        has recently faced a cyber-attack where the attackers broke into their network, found their way to
        their web
        server, and have successfully defaced their website <strong>
          http://www.imreallynotbatman.com
        </strong>
        . Their website is now showing the trademark of the attackers with the message <strong>
          YOUR SITE HAS BEEN DEFACED
        </strong>
        as shown below.<br /><br /><a
          href="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e8dd9a4a45e18443162feab/room-content/dcc528c218e8dda78504f55f58188575.png"><span
            class="image fit"><span class="image fit"></span><img src="images/49-4.png"
              alt="images/49-4.png" /></a><br /><br />They have
        requested
        &quot;<strong>US</strong>&quot; to join them as a <strong>Security Analyst</strong> and help them
        investigate this
        cyber attack and find the root cause and all the attackers&#39; activities within their
        network.<br /><br /><br />The good thing is, that they have Splunk already in place, so we have got all the
        event
        logs related to the attacker&#39;s activities captured. We need to explore the records and find how the
        attack got
        into their network and what actions they performed.<br /><br />This Investigation comes under the
        <code>Detection and Analysis phase.</code><br /><br /><strong>
          <h2>Splunk</h2>
        </strong><br />During our investigation, we will be using Splunk as
        our SIEM solution.
        Logs are being ingested from webserver/firewall/Suricata/Sysmon etc. We can explore
        the log sources showing visibility into both network-centric and host-centric
        activities.

          investigate are present in
          <code>index=botsv1</code><br />
