        <h2>ZAP Attack</h2>
      </header>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this lab we will be standing up a vulnerable web server called DVWA. It is designed from the ground up to
        teach people about a number of web application attacks.

        While a full intro to web attacks is out of the scope of this class, it is great to show you how to use tools
        like ZAP to automatically look for some vulnerabilities, and to show you that automated tools do not always
        catch everything.

        Let’s get started by opening a Terminal as Administrator
        PS C:\Users\adhd> `docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa`
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ZAP/DVWA.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      In another Command Prompt window run ipconfig and record your IP address. Remember, your IP address may be
      different from mine.

      C:\Users\adhd>`ipconfig`
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ZAP/IP.jpg" alt="" /></div>


      Now, let's start ZAP.

      Now, let's insert your IP address from the ipconfig command above and start the scan.

      First, select the Automated Scan button:

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ZAP/ZAPGUI.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      Then enter the URL of your Docker system. It will be in http:// syntax like below:

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ZAP/ZAPIP.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      Then select the Attack button:

      This will start the scan. You should be able to see the scan activity in the lower part of ZAP.

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ZAP/attack.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      Now, let's go back to the Powershell window and see the logs:

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ZAP/PowerShel.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      What are some things to look for?

      First, notice the high number of requests from an IP address in a very, very short time.

      Also, look for odd things like below:

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ZAP/SUS.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      But what would qualify as odd? Let's think this through. First, look at timing. Notice how fast the connections
      are comming in from a single IP. Also, notice how many of the same connections are going after the exact same
      thing again and again. Now, lets look for odd encodings. Looking for characters like %. Finally. spend some time
      getting to know what attacks look like at OWASP.

      The key for any SOC analysts is to first learn what is normal log traffic from the apps we monitor. Then, slowly
      we start attacking and seeing what the different attack patterns look like. There is no simple signature-based
      detection approach that works for all applications. The security industry has been trying this for years with
      various levels of success.

      Start by baselining normal.

      Then attack.

      It is all about knowing our networks ad apps.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      The Active Directory project simplifies the setup and management
      of a private network infrastructure, allowing organizations to efficiently address multiple users/clients while
      ensuring secure internet access. By leveraging Active Directory, RAS/NAT configuration, DHCP, and automation
      through PowerShell scripting, this project enables a streamlined and scalable approach to private network
      connectivity in a user-friendly manner.</p>
