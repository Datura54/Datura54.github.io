        <h2>TCPDump</h2>
      </header>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        TCPDump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer that allows SOC (Security Operations Center) and security
        analysts to capture and analyze network traffic. In this lab, we will explore some TCPDump filters that every
        analyst should know. By understanding these filters, analysts can effectively monitor and investigate network
        traffic for security purposes.</p>

      <p>The "host" filter allows analysts to focus on the traffic associated with a specific host. By specifying the
        IP address of interest, TCPDump displays the relevant packets, including their timestamps, protocols,
        source/destination IP addresses, control bit flags, sequence numbers, and data size. This filter is useful for
        isolating traffic related to a particular host and investigating any suspicious activities originating from or
        directed towards it.
      <p>
        `tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap host 192.168.99.52`</p>

      For this command we are telling tcpdump to not resolve hostnames (-n) and we are telling it to read in the
      data from a file (-r).</p>
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/1.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      <p>What is this exactly showing us? Well, it is showing each packet's timestamp, it's protocol, it's source IP
        address/port direction and destination IP address/port, it's control bit flags, sequence numbers and data
        size. But we can get the filter to be a bit more granular. In fact, you can create filters for literally every
        part
        of a packet!</p>

      <p>Adding the "port" filter narrows down the analysis to packets transmitted through a specific port number. This
        filter helps analysts identify traffic targeting or originating from a particular service or application. For
        example, filtering for port 80 would show HTTP-related traffic, allowing analysts to monitor web-related
        activities and detect potential web-based attacks.</p>

      <p>Let's add port number:

        `tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap host 192.168.99.52 and port 80`</p>
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/2.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      <p>In the screenshot above you can see we now have all the packets that are either sent or received by port 80 on
        192.168.99.52.</p>

      <p> While getting the overall metadata from the packets is nice, we can get the full ASCII decode of the packet
        and the payload of the packet. By including the "-A" flag, analysts can obtain the full ASCII decode and
        payload data of captured packets. This level of visibility enables analysts to inspect the actual content of
        network traffic, including HTTP requests and responses. This information is crucial for identifying
        potentially malicious commands or data within the payload, such as PowerShell scripts or encoded data.</p>
      $`tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap host 192.168.99.52 and port 80 -A`

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/3.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      <p>As you can see above, we now can see the actual http GET requests and the responses.</p>

      Lets dig into the packet with the timestamp of 08:14:32.638976

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/4.jpg" alt="" /></div>


      Ouch, it looks like PowerShell!!! A favorite of attackers and pentesters alike. Further, it looks like there
      is Base64 data.

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/5.jpg" alt="" /></div>


      <p>Still not enough? We can also see the raw Hex, if that is your sort of thing, with the -X flag. The "-X" flag
        provides analysts with the raw hexadecimal representation of packets. This view is useful for in-depth
        analysis, especially when examining lower-level protocol details or performing manual packet decoding. Viewing
        packets in raw hex format can reveal subtle anomalies or abnormalities that may be missed in other
        representations.</p>

      $`tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap host 192.168.99.52 and port 80 -AX`
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/6.jpg" alt="" /></div>


      <p> We can also specify specific protocols of interest. TCPDump allows analysts to focus on specific protocols of
        interest. For example, using the "ip6" filter captures only IPv6 traffic. This capability is valuable when
        investigating protocol-specific vulnerabilities or monitoring traffic for a particular protocol that may be
        targeted by attackers.</p>
      `tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap ip6`

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/7.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      <p>This is showing all the ipv6 traffic.</p>

      <p> We can also specify network ranges. This is very useful when you are seeing traffic either to or from a range
        of IP addresses. For example, this can help us answer questions like "are there any other systems talking to
        this IP address range?"</p>

      <p>Think of an attacker using multiple systems on a network range to disperse their C2 traffic. Analyzing traffic
        within specific network ranges can help identify potential communication patterns between systems. By
        specifying a network range using the "net" filter, analysts can determine if there are any other systems
        communicating with a particular IP address range. This information is crucial in detecting command-and-control
        (C2) traffic or identifying potential compromised systems within a network.</p>

      $`tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap net 192.168.99.0/24`
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/TCPDump/8.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>By mastering TCPDump filters, SOC and security analysts can become more proficient in identifying suspicious
        network behaviors, performing incident response, and protecting their organization's assets from potential
        security breaches.
