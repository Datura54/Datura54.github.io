        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Run a DNS Server (Pi-Hole) to see how it accepts, records, and forwards requests</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Manually generate DNS requests from the command line to our Pi-Hole DNS server using &quot;dig&quot;</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Log in to the DNS server and see the information it records from client lookups</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Look at the packets of the DNS traffic in Wireshark</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Use Suricata IDS signatures to detect suspicious DNS requests</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Use DNS event logs recorded by Suricata to identify DNS tunneling in a SIEM</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        <h3>Lab Setup</h3>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Tell your virtual machine to request a new DHCP lease. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> sudo dhclient -i ens33 -v</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Start the Suricata IDS, which will be used to capture our traffic:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> sudo suricata -c /labs/2.1/data/suricata.yaml -S /labs/2.1/data/emerging-dns.rules -i ens33 -D</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> After a moment (it may take a while for Suricata to start up depending on your CPU) you should see the
          following
          response:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-1.png"><img src="images/9-1.png"
              alt="images/9-1.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Next we must stop the built-in DNS resolver, use the following command to stop the systemd-resolved service.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> sudo service systemd-resolved stop</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Next start up Elasticsearch and Kibana using the following command:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> cd /labs/2.1</p>
        <p> docker-compose up -d</p>
        <p>
        <h5>1. Manually generate DNS requests via dig</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In the setup for this lab, we have started multiple services. To give you the full perspective of why we did
          that, here&#39;s what they are and why we started each:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Pi-Hole - A forwarding DNS server which can service DNS requests, cache answers, and perform recursive
          lookups. It also comes with a very nice web GUI for setup and monitoring which we will use to see the requests
          from the DNS server perspective.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Suricata IDS - Suricata will record a PCAP of all traffic, apply Snort-style IDS signatures to the
          traffic,
          and produce metadata events on all traffic it observes (regardless of signature matches).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Elasticsearch &amp; Kibana - Acting as our SIEM, Elasticsearch is the data store and Kibana is the front
          end
          for running searches and visualizing our data. It will store the event and alert logs we produce with
          Suricata.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In the following steps we&#39;re going to manually generate DNS traffic by sending requests to the Pi-Hole
          server. The goal of this lab is to see DNS requests from multiple viewpoints. To achieve this, Suricata is
          recording metadata event logs and a PCAP. That means we will see how the traffic looks in 3 ways:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • &quot;On the wire&quot; from the PCAP</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • Logs produced by Suricata observing the network traffic</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • As logged by the DNS server itself</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Now that we&#39;ve started our DNS server and the IDS is recording traffic, go back to your terminal. We
          will
          use &quot;dig&quot;, the DNS lookup utility to produce DNS requests. We will provide different command line
          arguments to dig to perform different types of DNS queries from the command line.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        <h3>A Record Request</h3>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In our terminal, use will use the following command to send an A record request for SEC450.com to the
          Pi-Hole:
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> dig @127.0.0.1 sec450.com A</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> The format of this command is dig [DNS server name] [lookup] [request type]. Since the Pi-Hole is not the
          standard DNS server used by our virtual machine we must specify which server to ask (the @127.0.0.1 argument),
          the
          second argument is the name we wish to resolve (sec450.com) and the third argument is the record type,
          &quot;A&quot; since we are doing an A record lookup.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should see the following output showing the A record for sec450.com.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-2.png"><img src="images/9-2.png"
              alt="images/9-2.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> The items of interest in the dig output are highlighted</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • The QUESTION section showing that we made an &quot;A&quot; record request about the hostname sec450.com
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • The ANSWER section shows the returned answer given by the Pi-Hole server</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • The SERVER line shows which server was used for the resolution.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This step shows how you can directly look up an A record for a given domain.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        <h3>PTR Record Request</h3>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Next, take the IP address found from the previous &quot;A&quot; record request and use it to perform a
          &quot;PTR&quot; record lookup for the IP address of A record for sec450.com. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> dig @127.0.0.1 -x 70.32.97.206</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should see the following output:</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-3.png"><img src="images/9-3.png"
              alt="images/9-3.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This step shows how you can directly look up a PTR record for a given IP address. Let&#39;s now look at
          where
          this answer comes from, but wait shouldn&#39;t the PTR Record return the hostname &quot;sec450.com&quot;? Yes
          and
          No, let me explain. </p>
        <p> A record lookups and PTR records do not always resolve a name faithfully, it is two different settings in
          two
          different locations! Imagine if I attacked your organization from the IP address 70.32.97.206 and, not having
          any
          other info, you performed a PTR record lookup and found it resolved to “simcoe.identityvector.com.”, that
          might
          be
          confusing if you don&#39;t understand how this system works! The idea is to not place full trust in PTR
          records,
          they rely on the owner of the IP address to fill them out and a malicious actor may fill in a false answer, or
          leave the information blank.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> The sec450.com domain was registered through Namecheap.com and the IP address (which was 70.32.97.206) was
          hosted on a VPS at DigitalOcean. While all other DNS records types must be setup through the DNS settings at
          the
          registrar (which was Namecheap), the PTR record is not, it is controlled by the company that owns the IP
          address.
          That means that while all other record types (A, CNAME, TXT, ...) are configured through logging in to
          Namecheap,
          the PTR record is actually set by logging in and changing it at DigitalOcean. In the management console at
          DigitalOcean, the name of the VPS can be changed to anything, and whatever is entered in this box becomes the
          PTR
          record.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-4.png"><img src="images/9-4.png"
              alt="images/9-4.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> The box above is in the VPS settings in the DigitalOcean console. If I were to fill this out with some other
          hostname, the PTR lookup would reflect that, regardless of if it were &quot;true&quot; or not. This means I
          could
          fill this box in with &quot;google.com&quot; and anyone making a PTR record request for this IP would see
          &quot;google.com&quot; returned instead.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        <h3>TXT Record Request</h3>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Next, use the following command to send an TXT record request for SEC450.com:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> dig @127.0.0.1 sec450.com TXT</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should see output similar to the following:</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-5.png"><img src="images/9-5.png"
              alt="images/9-5.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This step shows how you can directly look up the TXT record for a given domain.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        <h3>NS Record Request</h3>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Finally, let&#39;s check where the official name servers of sec450.com are with an NS request. Run the
          following
          command:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> dig @127.0.0.1 sec450.com NS</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should see a response similar to following:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-6.png"><img src="images/9-6.png"
              alt="images/9-6.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This tells us that, at the time of this screenshot, sec450.com DNS was handled by ns-1286.awsdns-32.org. |
          ns-1602.awsdns-08.co.uk. | ns-290.awsdns-36.com. | ns-581.awsdns-08.net.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Therefore, if we want a definitive answer on anything in the sec450.com zone, these are the authoritative
          name
          servers we would ask. They are the single &quot;source of truth&quot; for the sec450.com zone.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> These servers are the free DNS service provided by Amazon.</p>
        <p>
        <h5>2. Log in to Pi-Hole to see the DNS server view of your requests</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> We&#39;ll log in to the Pi-Hole server which resolved our requests in the previous step.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This is the Pi-Hole dashboard which will show statistics on all the DNS requests that have been recorded
          (note
          your numbers will be different than the screenshot).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Select the Query Log tab on the left side to see the individual logs that were created.</p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-7.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> The next page will show a list of all queries that were made in the recent past. As long as you have moved
          directly to this step from the previous page, you should now be able to find your sec450.com DNS lookups
          recorded.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> To filter it down, type &quot;sec450&quot; into the search box into the upper right of the page. You should
          now
          see a screen similar to the following.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-8.png"><img src="images/9-8.png"
              alt="images/9-8.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Here we can see the &quot;DNS server view&quot; of what DNS requests look like. Pi-Hole acts very similar to
          most DNS servers, whether Windows DNS, ISC Bind, or others. They all record the source of the incoming
          request,
          which we can see in the &quot;client&quot; column in this view, as well the lookup type and domain that was
          searched. In the &quot;Status&quot; column we can also see whether the request was forwarded or served from
          the
          DNS servers cache. If we were to look at the text-based log files produced by the pi-hole, we would see the
          same
          information. Pi-Hole also gives us the ability to easily block domains from this view if desired!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Now that we&#39;ve seen what the DNS server records, lets take a deeper look at the traffic by diving into
          the
          actual packets. We will leave the browser open in orther to watch new requests stream by until the end of the
          lab.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>3. View PCAPs for DNS traffic in Wireshark</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Next, switch back to the terminal and run the following command to enumerate the files in the Suricata
          logging
          folder.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> ls -l /var/log/suricata/lab2.1*</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You will need to find the file called lab2.1.pcap.[x] where the x is a number depending on the time of the
          capture. There should be only one result, but if you run the lab more than once there may be others present.
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Here&#39;s an example output you may see if you had more than one entry, pick the filename at the bottom of
          the
          list.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-9.png"><img src="images/9-9.png"
              alt="images/9-9.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Use this filename with the full path for the next command. This command will open Wireshark.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> wireshark /var/log/suricata/lab2.1.pcap.1688538292</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Press Enter to open Wireshark, if you see an error saying the file was cut short in the middle of a packet
          that
          is ok.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Once Wireshark is open, find your A record request for sec450.com take the following text and place it in
          the
          filter box in Wireshark.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> dns.qry.name == &quot;sec450.com&quot; &amp;&amp; (dns.qry.type == 1)</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should now see two lines in Wireshark with the A record request for sec450.com as shown below (depending
          on
          how the query was made by Pi-Hole there could be more than 2 lines, in my case i have 3 requests).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-10.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> How can we tell which entry is the response for a specific query? By looking at the hex number preceding the
          lookup type. In the case of the capture shown here the lookup was numbered 0x91de and the corresponding
          response
          has the same label as shown below. </p>

        <p> </p>
        <p> What about the other details? To dive into the packet details first click on the request packet in the
          Wireshark
          packet list. go down to the middle panel in Wireshark and find the line at the bottom that says &quot;Domain
          Name
          System (query)&quot; and expand it. Once expanded, find the line that says &quot;Queries&quot; and expand that
          as
          well. Then, expand the line that says &quot;sec450.com: type A, class IN&quot;.</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p> You should now see the additional detail on each field in the DNS request. Notice how each item in the Info
          line
          in the packet overview above is represented in the detail below, as well as additional details. In Wireshark,
          any
          time you need to find specific details on one of the layers of the network transaction you can use this panel
          to
          recursively expand fields until you drill down to the information you&#39;re looking for.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-13.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Next let&#39;s take a look at the TXT record request. Enter the following filter in Wireshark (the only
          difference is changing the &quot;1&quot; to a &quot;16&quot;).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> dns.qry.name == &quot;sec450.com&quot; &amp;&amp; (dns.qry.type == 16)</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Now we can see at least two lines in Wireshark with the TXT record request for sec450.com as shown below
          (depending on how the query was made by Pi-Hole there could be more).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-14.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Remember when this request was made we saw the TXT record contents printed to the screen in the dig output.
          Notice that while the response to an &quot;A&quot; record was shown in the info line in Wireshark, TXT record
          responses are not, so in this case we must go into the details to see the response in Wireshark.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Click on the packet that says &quot;query response&quot; in the info column in Wireshark this time. Unfold
          the
          layers of the packet in the middle pane in Wireshark so that both the &quot;Answers&quot; section as well as
          the
          &quot;sec450.com: TXT, class IN&quot; item beneath it are unfolded, as shown below:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-15.png"><img src="images/9-15.png"
              alt="images/9-15.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> From this view we can see the TXT record response Hello SEC450 lab 2.1! ;)</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This is how we can investigate DNS traffic in a PCAP in Wireshark.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Now let&#39;s look at all DNS activity. Delete the current filter in the Wireshark search bar and replace it
          simply with the filter dns and press enter.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-16.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Notice there is much more activity than just the packets we generated. This is because your system is
          constantly
          running background processes that make DNS requests, and open web pages and other tools can create traffic as
          well.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> We are now done looking at the PCAP, close Wireshark using the X in the upper right corner and return to
          your
          terminal.</p>
        <p>
        <h5>4. Detect malicious DNS requests via IDS</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In this section, we&#39;ll see the Suricata Intrusion Detection System in action by picking out a suspicious
          DNS
          request with a signature. To do this we&#39;ll look at the /var/log/suricata/fast.log file, which gives a
          one-line
          summary of any IDS alerts being generated by what Suricata has observed in live traffic.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Open a second terminal and run the following command to show the fast.log from Suricata.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> There will be no output yet. Your screen should now look something like this..</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-17.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Switch back to your first terminal window, but keep this new window open as you perform the next steps, it
          will
          print anything the IDS engine detects in real-time.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Although the full detail for every alert is stored in Suricata&#39;s eve.json log, the eve.json&#39;s JSON
          format is better ingested and viewed with the SIEM, the fast.log file is better used for easily readable quick
          checks.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> To trigger an alert from Suricata, enter the following command into the first terminal. Note that you may
          need
          to send it several times before the alert appears:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> dig @8.8.8.8 sec450.top A</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should see the 2nd terminal running &quot;tail&quot; print an alert to the screen as shown below. If it
          does
          not work on the first try, press the up arrow on the keyboard to reload the command and try it again.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-18.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This is an alert from the Suricata alert engine that tells us a suspicious DNS request was made!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You can now click on the terminal running the tail command and press Ctrl + c to stop it. You can now close
          this
          terminal by clicking the &quot;x&quot; in the upper right.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Why did this specific traffic trigger an alert when nothing else so far has? If we look into the alert rule
          list
          we started Suricata with, we can find the answer. To look up a rule, you can use it&#39;s unique identifier.
          In
          the case of the alert we just set off, it&#39;s 2023883 as seen in the alert output.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-19.png"><img src="images/9-19.png"
              alt="images/9-19.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> In the terminal, enter the following command to see the rule in the rules list.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> grep 2023883 /labs/2.1/data/emerging-dns.rules</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should see the following output.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-20.png"><span class="image fit"><img
                src="images/9-20.png" alt="images/9-20.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This rule effectively says &quot;If Suricata sees traffic from any internal IP address and any source port
          to
          any destination IP and port that contains .top, alert&quot;. Since we looked up sec450.top, this matches the
          rule
          and it fired the alert! This is a simple demonstration of how a DNS based Intrusion Detection System works! In
          a
          production setup scenario, this alert would then be sent to analysts to triage and investigate.</p>
        <p>
        <h5>5. Detect malicious DNS requests via SIEM Analysis</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> While Suricata may pick up many types of malicious traffic with one of it&#39;s signatures, signatures are
          ultimately still a block list-based technique that relies on enumerating &quot;known bad&quot;, an impossible
          task
          to cover all situations with. While this approach can catch a large portion of problems, there will always be
          additional attacks for which you don&#39;t have signatures. For attacks that use new atomic indicators
          (domains,
          hashes), or methods that are unknown, we must rely on other methods to pick up malicious activity, and that is
          where SIEM analysis comes in.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Let&#39;s say you have malware utilizing DNS tunneling within your environment. If you do not know the
          domain
          is
          malicious and the TLD is not something that Suricata will alert on (such as the .top domain in the previous
          step),
          how can you pick it up? Given what we know about DNS tunneling and how it has to use high-frequency, long,
          encoded
          looking subdomains, if we have the log of all DNS requests made, we should still be able to find it!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> For this next step, we will open Kibana to a set of pre-ingested DNS data:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> The following window shows DNS request details:</p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-21.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This page shows selected fields information as recorded by Suricata while observing DNS traffic. Note that
          this
          is event metadata such as the source and destination IP, request type, and hostname.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Within this set of recorded data is an active DNS tunneling command and control channel. While scrolling
          through
          the records may eventually highlight the domain that was used, it&#39;s much easier to find it via visual
          analysis. To do that we will go to a configured DNS dashboard</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> We can see now a dashboard with multiple different visualizations created by the data we saw on the previous
          tab.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-22.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Each one of these visualizations highlights the domain that was used for an attack, showing that there are
          multiple easy ways to identify DNS tunneling, assuming you have the data and it is parsed correctly.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • DNS Heatmap - Fist look at the box labeled &quot;DNS Heatmap&quot;, this is a visualization showing DNS
          requests over time, split up by the parent domain they were going to. Although it is least obvious in this
          chart,
          we can see the domain contentdelivery.info is at the top with the most traffic. Could this be the domain
          we&#39;re
          looking for?</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-23.png"><img src="images/9-23.png"
              alt="images/9-23.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • DNS Table - Next look at the item to the right of the heatmap labeled &quot;DNS Table&quot; this is
          breakdown
          of the total count of domain queries per parent domain, again contentdelivery.info dominates this list by a
          large
          margin. Since we know DNS tunneling requires lots of requests over time, this also lines up with what we saw
          in
          the heatmap.</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-24.png"><img src="images/9-24.png"
              alt="images/9-24.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • DNS Types - Look at the bottom left item labeled &quot;DNS Types&quot; This is a chart per domain, showing
          the
          breakdown what types of DNS queries were made for them. Notice that while almost all entries consist of
          &quot;A&quot; and &quot;AAAA&quot; records, contentdelivery.info is mostly CNAME, MX, and TXT record requests,
          an
          incredibly odd breakdown compared to normal DNS activity (which should be mostly A record requests).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-25.png"><img src="images/9-25.png"
              alt="images/9-25.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> • DNS Subdomains - The final item on the list is the &quot;DNS Subdomains&quot; visualization. This
          breakdown
          shows how many unique subdomains were used from each top level domain - a characteristic that would highlight
          the
          encoded data used for DNS tunneling. In this graph, we can clearly see that contentdelivery.info has way more
          subdomains than any other item in the list.</p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-26.png"><img src="images/9-26.png"
              alt="images/9-26.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Given all of this information, it would be quite safe to assume that something highly suspicious is going on
          here and that it&#39;s very likely DNS tunneling is being used with this domain.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Although we have no signature for DNS tunneling active in Suricata, this dashboard shows that attacks like
          this
          are still incredibly easy to catch...if you know where to look.</p>
        <p>
        <h5>6. Explore DNS over HTTPS Traffic in Wireshark</h5>

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Now a bit outside of the scope of the lab, let&#39;s explore how DoH queries look in Wireshark, run the
          following command in a terminal.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> wireshark -r doh_example.pcap -Y &quot;dns and tls&quot; -o
          &#39;tls.keylog_file:/labs/2.1/sslkeylog.log&#39;
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This command will open a pre-created example capture of DoH trafic with the decryption keys in place needed
          to
          decrypt and read it and a Wireshark display filter of dns and tls, which narrows packets down to DoH only (you
          cannot simply use &quot;doh&quot; like you can with other protocol names at the time of this writing). The
          screenshot below shows the resolution of A and AAAA records for isc.sans.edu.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-27.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> SIDE NOTE: If you are looking for a specific information you can ctrl+F, select to search by string in this
          case
          and Wireshark will search for you the packet you are hunting, like this:</p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-28.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Back to the lab we can alternatively, use the broader filter (dns and tls) or http2 to show both the DoH
          query
          and the HTTP/2 portion. This filter shows both the DoH packet and the preceeding HTTP/2 packet that
          facilitates
          it. Although we have not yet discussed HTTP/2, note that there is an HTTP/2 protocol POST request to the URL
          &quot;/dns-query&quot;. This is because DoH is literally talking to an HTTP server to make a DNS request
          embedded
          within an HTTP request!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/9-29.png" alt="" /></span>
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Also note that the DNS transaction ID is now 0x0000 for all requests. How do we then track a response to a
          given
          request? We now need to use the HTTP/2 stream identifier. The easiest way to trace the unique answer to a DoH
          request in the above screenshot would be to right-click on a packet like #552 in the screenshot, select
          &quot;Follow&quot;, then select &quot;HTTP/2 Stream&quot;. Wireshark in this specific scenario would apply the
          filter tcp.stream eq 2 and http2.streamid eq 81. This filters traffic down to just the unique TCP connection
          to
          the DoH server and the HTTP/2 stream identifier, &quot;81&quot; in this case (seen in packet #552 in brackets
          after the word &quot;HEADERS&quot;).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> This capture is Firefox using it&#39;s built-in default DNS over HTTPS functionality. If you&#39;d like to
          see
          what this traffic looks like without the encryption keys applied, close wireshark and reopen the capture with
          the
          command below that omits the -o argument (which provides the decryption keys).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> wireshark -r doh_example.pcap -Y &quot;dns and tls&quot;</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> You should see the following:</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-30.png"><img src="images/9-30.png"
              alt="images/9-30.png" /></a><a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Where&#39;d the traffic go? Note that without the decryption keys provided, the DoH traffic can no longer be
          identified by Wireshark due to encryption! DNS simply looks like any other TLS traffic without decryption, so
          the
          filter won&#39;t find anything to show you!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> If you want to narrow down the traffic to only what you saw before (but now encrypted), switch the Wireshark
          filter to tls and ip.addr == 70.32.97.206 instead of dns and tls. This limits traffic to the IP of
          Amazon&#39;s
          DoH server used by Firefox which is now wrapped in TLS encryption.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <a href="http://../../../../Desktop/project"> </a><a
            href="file:///C:/Users/Leugim/Desktop/project/images/15-31.png"><span class="image fit"><img

        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Doesn&#39;t look like much does it? That&#39;s the point, and hopefully it&#39;s also further motivation to
          get
          that TLS decryption effort moving, without it, you&#39;ll soon have no idea what domains are being resolved!
