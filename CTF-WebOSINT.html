          </strong>We have to take into account that this CTF was published around 2022, and as we previously saw the
          domain we have to investigate is Namecheap. So with this in mid the answer is, IP Address changed 4 times,
          eventhough nowadays he changed way more then that <a href=""><span class="image fit"><img

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            Throughout this investigation, I employed various techniques including WHOIS queries, DNS history analysis,
            web search skills, and domain correlation to piece together the puzzle of the security breach. By combining
            these skills, I was able to identify key information, uncover hidden connections, and ultimately make
            informed conclusions about the nature of the breach and the entities involved. Here's a summary of the tasks
            and the findings:<br><br>

            Task 1: Whois Registration<br>

            Discovered the company name associated with the registered domain: Namecheap Inc.
            Identified the phone number for the registration company: 6613102107.
            Found the first nameserver listed for the site: NS1.BRAINYDNS.COM.
            Obtained the registrant's name, although redacted for privacy.
