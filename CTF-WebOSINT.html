          </strong>Based on the other domains hosted on the same IP address, what kind of hosting service can we safely
          assume our target uses?<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>The question here is not to find what the target does with the IP Address but to find if he shares
          this IP with other services <a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/38-13.png"
                alt="images/38-13.png" /></a>Based on

          </strong>We have to take into account that this CTF was published around 2022, and as we previously saw the
          the domain we have to investigate is Namecheap. So with this in mind the answer is, IP Address changed 4
          times,
          even though nowadays he changed way more then that <a href=""><span class="image fit"><img

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            Throughout this investigation, I employed various techniques including WHOIS queries, DNS history
            analysis,
            web search skills, and domain correlation to piece together the puzzle of the security breach. By
            combining
            these skills, I was able to identify key information, uncover hidden connections, and ultimately make
            informed conclusions about the nature of the breach and the entities involved. Here's a summary of the
            tasks
            and the findings:<br><br>

            Task 1: Whois Registration<br>

            Discovered the company name associated with the registered domain: Namecheap Inc.
            Identified the phone number for the registration company: 6613102107.
            Found the first nameserver listed for the site: NS1.BRAINYDNS.COM.
