      <p>I set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connected it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We
        will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. We will use a custom
        PowerShell script to look up the attacker's Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel
        Map!<span alt="Pasted image 20230518102649.png" src="Pasted image 20230518102649.png"

        For you to be able to put this information on the map you have to let this script run. otherwise,
        the information about a failed RDP will never leave the event viewer and get to our Azure <br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230527164329.png" src="Pasted image 20230527164329.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230527164329.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230527164329.png"></span>
      </p>
      <h1>Setup VM</h1>
      <p>Firstly you have to have an Azure subscription, for this Lab you can have a free 30-day trial
        here:<br>
        <a rel="no opener" class="external-link" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/"
          target="_blank">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/</a><br>
        After you created you subscription go to <strong>portal.azure.com</strong> you will be here<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518103518.png" src="Pasted image 20230518103518.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518103518.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518103518.png"></span><br>
        Type on the search bar <strong>Virtual Machines</strong>. This will be the VM that will be exposed
        to the internet and hackers from all over the world will be trying to break into it/login into
        it.<br>
        To create it go to <strong>Create</strong> and add <strong>Azure virtual machine</strong><br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518103849.png" src="Pasted image 20230518103849.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518103849.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518103849.png"></span><br>
        Create a new resource pot, which is just a folder on Azure that you can use to organize projects<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518104638.png" src="Pasted image 20230518104638.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518104638.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518104638.png"></span><br>
        Important things here is <strong>Image</strong> make sure you have the win10 image<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518105429.png" src="Pasted image 20230518105429.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518105429.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518105429.png"></span><br>
        If you get some kind of error on <strong>size</strong>, change your VM location, it doesn't
        matter where you put it unless you cannot progress. Hit <strong>Next: Disks &gt;</strong><br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518105819.png" src="Pasted image 20230518105819.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518105819.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518105819.png"></span><br>
        Click <strong>Next: Networking &gt;</strong> Select <strong>Advanced</strong> and then
        <strong>Create new</strong><br>
        Think of <strong>NIC network security group</strong> as a Firewall, the thing is this firewall will
        be open to everyone and everything<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518114515.png" src="Pasted image 20230518114515.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518114515.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518114515.png"></span><br>
        So remove The already defined Inbound Rule and letÂ´s set up a new one<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518114730.png" src="Pasted image 20230518114730.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518114730.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518114730.png"></span><br>
        To do that <strong>Add an inbound rule</strong>, then just copy my Selections<br>
        I changed the <strong>Destination port ranges</strong> and place an asterisk, so that any protocol
        that our machine receives will be managed by our Firewall. Also, lowered <strong>Priority</strong>
        to "100" making this role more important. Choose any name you want. <strong>Add &gt; OK &gt; Review
          + Create &gt; Create</strong><br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230518114946.png" src="Pasted image 20230518114946.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518114946.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518114946.png"></span><br>
        What we did was make our VM more discoverable and enticing for other hackers around the globe to try to
        hack it. Normally we would want the opposite but for the objective of our Lab, we want them to find
        us.
      </p>
      <h1>FIREWALL OFF</h1>
      <p>First we will turn the firewall off so that people can find our VM faster<br>
        So, Open your Windows Defender Firewall<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524123143.png" src="Pasted image 20230524123143.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524123143.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524123143.png"></span><br>
        Enter on <strong>Windows Defender Firewall Properties</strong><br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524123322.png" src="Pasted image 20230524123322.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524123322.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524123322.png"></span><br>
        Now just go to each page <strong>Domain Profile, Private Profile and Public Profile</strong> and
        turn the <strong>Firewall State</strong> to OFF, apply and ok<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524123558.png" src="Pasted image 20230524123558.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524123558.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524123558.png"></span><br>
        Now for us to see the change we can ping using our real machine our VM by going to
        <strong>CMD</strong> in our own computer and pinging the IP address of the VM<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524124401.png" src="Pasted image 20230524124401.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524124401.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524124401.png"></span><br>
        And then after we turn the firewall off this is what it looks like<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524124332.png" src="Pasted image 20230524124332.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524124332.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524124332.png"></span><br>
        If you don't understand what this means, it's ok, Google is your friend.
      </p>
      <h1>Azure Sentinel Setup I guess or Windows CHECK THIS</h1>
      <p><span alt="Pasted image 20230518130353.png" src="Pasted image 20230518130353.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230518130353.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230518130353.png"></span><br>
        Here we will setup Sentinel, to do that type "Microsoft Sentinel"<br>
        <strong>Create Azure Sentinel</strong>, then pick your workspace <strong>Add</strong><br>
        Wait a bit<br>
        Then search "Virtual Machines"<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524105258.png" src="Pasted image 20230524105258.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524105258.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524105258.png"></span><br>
        Click on your VM and copy your <strong>Public Address</strong> so we can connect to your VM
        remotely<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524105506.png" src="Pasted image 20230524105506.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524105506.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524105506.png"></span><br>
        So click on your Windows icon, on your personal machine, search "Remote Desktop Connection"<br>
        and paste the IP Address, hit connect<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524114949.png" src="Pasted image 20230524114949.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524114949.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524114949.png"></span><br>
        And login with the credentials you created earlier<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524115120.png" src="Pasted image 20230524115120.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524115120.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524115120.png"></span><br>
        If this appears to you hist hit yes<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524115228.png" src="Pasted image 20230524115228.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524115228.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524115228.png"></span><br>
        As a normal Windows setup, just say no to everything and then accept<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230524115456.png" src="Pasted image 20230524115456.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Pasted image 20230524115456.png"
            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230524115456.png"></span><br>
        and it's done, now we are connected to the VM by our own computer
      </p>
