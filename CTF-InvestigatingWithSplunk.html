            <h2>Scenario Notes:</h2>
          </strong>• SOC Analyst Johny noticed anomalous behaviors in Windows machine logs.<br>
          • Adversary access and
          backdoor creation detected.<br>
          • Logs pulled from suspected hosts, ingested into Splunk for investigation.<br>
          • Focus on identifying unauthorized access, privilege escalation, unusual network traffic, and
          processes.<strong>
            <h2>Objective:</h2>
          </strong>Examine anomalous behaviors in Windows machine logs and identify signs of unauthorized access,
          potential backdoors, and timely threat detection.<strong>
            <h2>Question 1:</h2>
          </strong>How many events were collected and Ingested in the index <strong>main</strong>?<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>Query the database with “*” to get every single event, and select the preset timestamp “All
          time”<a href=""><img src="images/27-1.png" alt="images/27-1.png" /></a>The answer is just
          bellow<strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>12256<strong>
            <h2>Question 2:</h2>
          </strong>On one of the infected hosts, the adversary was successful in creating a backdoor user. What is the
          new username?<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>With a quick Google search we can find that the event id for creating a new user is “ID 4720”<a
            href=""><img src="images/27-2.png" alt="images/27-2.png" /></a><br>
          With this information we can just go to
          the selected fields of our splunk and search who were the new users created <a href=""><img
              src="images/27-3.png" alt="images/27-3.png" /></a>Luckily there was only one user created so we just
          have to find his username<a href=""><img src="images/27-4.png" alt="images/27-4.png" /></a><strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>A1berto<strong>
            <h2>Question 3:</h2>
          </strong>On the same host, a registry key was also updated regarding the new backdoor user. What is the full
          path of that registry key?<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>Most efficient way of finding this would be to use the search function. We would need to search for
          logs with Windows EventID 12, as this indicates created registry keys. Also we can specify which
          “TargetObject”
          we
          are looking for to filter out any other unwanted logs.<a href=""><img src="images/27-5.png"
              alt="images/27-5.png" /></a><strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names\A1berto<strong>
            <h2>Question 4:</h2>
          </strong>Examine the logs and identify the user that the adversary was trying to impersonate.<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>On this question we could assume that the name the attacker is trying to impersona in Alberto,
          because he used “A1berto” as his new user, but let&#39;s confirm.<a href=""><img src="images/27-6.png"
              alt="images/27-6.png" /></a>Just like we assumed, there are only two users “Alberto&quot; and
          “James”. Is this a 50/50 or a 100/0? <strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>Alberto<strong>
            <h2>Question 5:</h2>
          </strong>What is the command used to add a backdoor user from a remote computer?<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>From the last print in the Question 2 we can see that the subject that created &quot;A1berto&quot; is
          James. So if we query the database for every event made by him we will see the creation of “A1berto”<a
            href=""><img src="images/27-7.png" alt="images/27-7.png" /></a>After looking at Interesting Fields,
          “CommandLine” has our answer <strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>C:\windows\System32\Wbem\WMIC.exe&quot; /node:WORKSTATION6 process call create &quot;net user /add
          A1berto paw0rd1<strong>
            <h2>Question 6:</h2>
          </strong>How many times was the login attempt from the backdoor user observed during the
          investigation?<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>Let&#39;s look for Categories of events and we will find out that out of the 5 events there is 1
          Network Connection detected<a href=""><img src="images/27-8.png" alt="images/27-8.png" /></a>After
          investigating,thanks to the image field where it specifies
          that “WMIC.exe” was used, it becomes clear that thi event is the event detected on the creation of the user.
          Meaning
          there was no login attempt from the backdoor user<a href=""><img src="images/27-9.png"
              alt="images/27-9.png" /></a><strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>0<strong>
            <h2>Question 7:</h2>
          </strong>What is the name of the infected host on which suspicious Powershell commands were
          executed?<strong>
            <h3>Explanation:</h3>
          </strong>If we Query the database for only powershell events, and look for the “hostname” field it will on
          show one host “James.Browne” <a href=""><img src="images/27-10.png" alt="images/27-10.png" /></a><strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>James.Browne<strong>
            <h2>Question 8:</h2>
          </strong>PowerShell logging is enabled on this device. How many events were logged for the malicious
          PowerShell execution?<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>We can find this answer based on the same query. We just need to look into the field “Categories” and
          find how many events were logged <a href=""><img src="images/27-11.png" alt="images/27-11.png" /></a><strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>79<strong>
            <h2>Question 9:</h2>
          </strong>An encoded Powershell script from the infected host initiated a web request. What is the full
          URL?<strong>
            <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          </strong>On every powershell event in the Message field the is a huge encrypted message. So we will decrypt it
          using cyberchef and see what happens<br>
          <a href=""><img src="images/27-12.png" alt="images/27-12.png" /></a><br>
          After
          using cyberchef and scrolling with little hope, i found this specific
          block of the code<a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/27-13.png"
                alt="images/27-13.png" /></a>Now
          with more
          hopes i used again cyberchef.<a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/27-14.png"
                alt="images/27-14.png" /></a>After
          Decrypting and finding/replacing junk. I got the IP Address. Now
          let&#39;s remember that we are not looking for an IP bur for an URL and just after the encoded string we found
          there
          is “<a href="http://10[.]10[.]10[.]5/news.php">news.php</a>”. So we just have to got to cyberchef once again
          and
          defand the URL to get our answear <a href=""><span class="image fit"><img src="images/27-15.png"
                alt="images/27-15.png" /></a><strong>
            <h2>Answer:</h2>
          </strong>hxxp[://]10[.]10[.]10[.]5/news[.]php<strong>
            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            This investigation successfully uncovered signs of unauthorized access, potential backdoors, and
            other suspicious activities in Windows machine logs. The proactive analysis conducted by SOC Analyst Johny,
            coupled with the capabilities of Splunk, enabled the timely detection and understanding of the security
            incidents, ultimately enhancing the organization's threat detection and response capabilities.<br><br>
            1. A total of 12,256 events were collected and ingested in the main index for analysis.<br><br>
            2.The adversary successfully created a backdoor user on one of the infected hosts, and the new username was
            identified as &quot;A1berto.&quot;<br><br>
            3. On the same host, a registry key related to the new backdoor user was updated.
            The full path of that registry key was found to be
            &quot;HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names\A1berto.&quot;<br><br>
            4. While examining the logs, it was confirmed that the adversary was trying to impersonate the user
            &quot;Alberto.&quot;<br><br>
            5. The command used by the adversary to add a backdoor user from a remote computer was identified as
            &quot;C:\windows\System32\Wbem\WMIC.exe&quot; /node:WORKSTATION6 process call create &quot;net user /add
            A1berto
            paw0rd1.&quot;<br><br>
            6. Although the backdoor user was created, no login attempts were observed from the backdoor user during the
            investigation.<br><br>
            7. The infected host where suspicious PowerShell commands were
            executed was identified as &quot;James.Browne.&quot;<br><br>
            8. The device had PowerShell logging enabled, and a
            total of 79 events were logged for the malicious PowerShell execution.<br><br>
            9. An encoded PowerShell script
            from the infected host initiated a web request. After decrypting the script using CyberChef, the full URL
            &quot;hxxp[://]10[.]10[.]10[.]5/news[.]php&quot; was defanged due to TryHackMe&#39;s
            request.
