        <h4 class='title'>Introduction</h4><br />
        <p> The HTB Lisbon meetup was an event organized by Academia de Código. If you were into hacking,
          cybersecurity, or just curious, this was the place to be.

          What was it about? It was about why Blue Teams, are the hidden heroes of cyber. These are the experts who
          defend our
          digital world from all the bad stuff. Catarina Soeiro, a cybersecurity analyst and part of the Blue Team crew,
          took the stage to showcase exactly what blue teams do, why they're such a big deal, and why being on the blue
          side is way cooler
          than it might sound.</p>

        <h4 class='title'>The apresentation covered the following security topics:</h4><br />

        • First off, attendees got insights into the tools used by Security Operations Centers (SOCs) for detection. It
        was a peek into the tech side of things, showcasing how professionals keep an eye on potential threats and what
        are the best practices to be an efficient SOC team.<br> <br>

        • The highlight of the event was a real-world case study. Catarina walked everyone through the whole journey –
        how
        they spotted the breach, what steps were taken to address it, and all the actions that followed. It was like
        stepping into the shoes of investigators as they unraveled a scenario where a hacker successfully infiltrated a
        system. <br> <br>

        • To help break down this complex attack scenario, Catarina introduced a couple of frameworks – the "kill
        chain" and "MITRE ATT&CK." And some tools that made the detection possible – Splunk (SIEM), Snort (IDS), and
        Volatility (Forensic Analysis). These tools and frameworks helped organize the attack step by step, giving
        everyone a hands-on understanding of how these techniques are applied in the real world. <br> <br>

        <h4 class='title'>Conclusion</h4><br />

        On an ending note, Catarina answered questions from the public, where we talked about more in-depth about some
        possible usage of other tools and how they would influence our study-case detection capabilities and was at
        this time that after a question about what she look forward to in the future of SOC, she delved into the
        possibility of a SOC2.0 where we would not only detect bad actors but also actively look for them.<br>

        The event was a unique opportunity to delve into the intriguing world of cybersecurity, learn from an expert
        like Catarina, and gain valuable insights into blue teams and their pivotal role in safeguarding our digital
        universe. A big thank you to Academia de Código for organizing this event and to Catarina Soeiro for sharing her
        expertise and insights with us.
