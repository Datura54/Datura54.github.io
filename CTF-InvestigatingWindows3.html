          <h2>Scenario Notes:</h2>
        </strong>• SOC Analyst Johny noticed anomalous behaviors in Windows machine logs.• Adversary access and
        backdoor creation detected.• Logs pulled from suspected hosts, ingested into Splunk for investigation.•
        Focus on identifying unauthorized access, privilege escalation, unusual network traffic, and
        processes.<strong>
          <h2>Objective:</h2>
        </strong>Successfully investigate and identify anomalous behaviors in Windows machine logs to detect and
        mitigate potential security breaches in a real-world scenario.<strong>

          <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        </strong>1. A Web Browser Password Viewer was executed on the infected machine, with the binary located at
        &quot;C:\Users\FINANC~1\AppData\Local\Temp\11111.exe&quot;.2. The company name listed in the logs was
        &quot;Nirsoft.&quot;3. Another suspicious binary, &quot;IonicLarge.exe,&quot; was executed from the same
        folder as the previous binary. Its original filename was listed as &quot;PalitExplorer.exe&quot; (format:
        IonicLarge.exe,PalitExplorer.exe).4. The binary &quot;IonicLarge.exe&quot; made two outbound connections
        to the malicious IP address &quot;2[.]56[.]59[.]42&quot;.5. The same binary, &quot;IonicLarge.exe,&quot;
        made changes to the Windows Defender registry key path &quot;HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
        Defender&quot;.6. Two processes were killed, and their associated binaries were deleted. The names of
        the binaries were &quot;phcIAmLJMAIMSa9j9MpgJo1m.exe&quot; and &quot;WvmIOrcfsuILdX6SNwIRmGOJ.exe&quot; (format:
        phcIAmLJMAIMSa9j9MpgJo1m.exe,WvmIOrcfsuILdX6SNwIRmGOJ.exe).7. The attacker ran several commands within a
        PowerShell session to change Windows Defender&#39;s behavior. The last executed command was &quot;powershell
        WMIC
        /NAMESPACE:\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender PATH MSFT_MpPreference call Add ThreatIDDefaultAction_Ids=2147737394
        ThreatIDDefaultAction_Actions=6 Force=True&quot;.8. The attacker set four IDs in chronological order of
        execution: 2147735503, 2147737010, 2147737007, 2147737394 9. Another malicious binary,
        &quot;EasyCalc.exe,&quot; was executed on the infected workstation from the location
        &quot;C:\Users\Finance01\AppData\Roaming\EasyCalc\EasyCalc.exe&quot;.10. The DLLs loaded from the
        &quot;EasyCalc.exe&quot; binary were &quot;ffmpeg.dll,&quot; &quot;nw.dll,&quot; and &quot;nw_elf.dll&quot;
