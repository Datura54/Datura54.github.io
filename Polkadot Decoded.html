            <p>
              Hey there, folks! I just attended an awesome presentation by Regina Vito and Kevin Valerio from Sr Labs.
              They delved into the exciting world of securing the Polkadot ecosystem and covered some impactful
              vulnerabilities along with introducing best practices. Let&#39;s dive into it!
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Regina and Kevin, kicked off the presentation with a rather alarming example of what could happen if
              security is neglected or if a palette isn&#39;t configured securely. They painted a vivid picture of a
              hypothetical project called Sr Chain experiencing downtime, causing panic among the team and leading to a
              drop
              in token prices. Yikes! None of us would want to be in that situation, right?
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              The specific issue they highlighted was a misconfiguration problem with the elections palette. You see,
              the
              elections palette aims to implement a form of democracy, where more participation translates to a more
              democratic system. However, when you have limited resources and execution time, allowing voters to vote
              for
              multiple candidates can cause a massive computation overload. This overload can lead to timeouts and make
              validators or collectors miss their slots. Fortunately, Sr Labs discovered this bug a few months ago and
              responsibly disclosed it to the project team, who then shared the fix with the wider ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Polkadot/1-2.jpeg" alt="images/1-2.png" /></span></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              But that wasn&#39;t the only bug they found! Regina and Kevin emphasized that they&#39;ve come across
              numerous vulnerabilities in their work, and they&#39;ve been actively helping teams mitigate and fix them.
              They promised to share more examples, so let&#39;s dive into that.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              The presentation took us through various aspects of securing a blockchain project, starting with ensuring
              integrity. Users need to trust that their actions and transactions will be executed as intended. Regina
              explained that threats to integrity could include vesting period manipulations, where malicious token
              holders
              find a way to spend tokens before the intended time, thus undermining the system&#39;s integrity. They
              also
              discussed censorship attacks, where trusted validators or collators manipulate or censor transactions, and
              front-running attacks, which no one wants to encounter.
            </p>
            <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Polkadot/1-3.jpeg" alt="images/1-3.png" /></span></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Next, they covered the importance of availability. A blockchain project should strive to provide
              uninterrupted service to its users, allowing them to carry out their operations seamlessly. They
              highlighted
              issues like incorrect weight calculations and runtime panics that can disrupt the availability of the
              blockchain, resulting in frustrated users and a poor user experience.
            </p>
            <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Polkadot/1-4.jpeg" alt="images/1-4.png" /></span></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              To address these challenges, Sr Labs follows a comprehensive methodology. They start with threat modeling,
              putting themselves in the shoes of potential hackers to understand their motives and identify potential
              vulnerabilities. Then comes the design verification phase, where they dive into the project&#39;s
              documentation to assess if the team has already considered and mitigated threats. The next step is the
              hacking
              phase, where they perform manual code analysis, along with dynamic and static analysis using fuzzing and
              other
              tools. Lastly, they support the remediation process, helping teams fix the bugs they discovered and
              ensuring
              new issues don&#39;t arise in the process.
            </p>
            <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Polkadot/1-5.jpeg" alt="images/1-5.png" /></span></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              It&#39;s worth noting that Sr Labs doesn&#39;t limit their impact to individual assessments. They actively
              participate in the substrate Builders program, providing security assessments for power chains being
              onboarded
              to Polkadot. They&#39;ve worked with several live projects and have found various bugs, as showcased in
              their
              presentation.
            </p>
            <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Polkadot/1-6.jpeg" alt="images/1-6.png" /></span></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Kevin took the stage to delve into the technical aspects of impactful bugs. He focused on the availability
              of the Polkadot ecosystem and how collectors, which facilitate communication among chains, can be
              vulnerable
              to malicious attacks. Crafted malicious exchanges sent to collectors can trigger panics, causing crashes
              and
              disruptions across the system. Clearly, these bugs have severe consequences for users, parachains, and
              developers alike. It&#39;s crucial to address them promptly to maintain a smooth and uninterrupted
              experience.

            <p></p>
            <p>
              As the presentation came to a close, Regina and Kevin shared some best practices they've learned through
              their extensive experience. They emphasized the importance of performing benchmarking, as it has been a
              common issue they've observed during their assessments. They encouraged blockchain projects to prioritize
              benchmarking to ensure optimal performance and security. They also highlighted arithmetic issues and the
              emerging trend of reachable panic issues, cautioning against following that particular trend.
            </p>
            <p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Polkadot/1-8.jpeg" alt="images/1-8.png" /></span></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              In summary, Regina and Kevin&#39;s presentation was an eye-opening journey into securing the Polkadot
              ecosystem. They showcased their expertise in identifying vulnerabilities, their comprehensive methodology,
              and their commitment to helping teams mitigate and fix issues.

              Attending this presentation was a valuable learning experience for me. It reiterated the critical role
              security plays in the blockchain world, the importance of proactive measures to protect users and maintain
              a robust ecosystem, and helped me answer fundamental questions regarding security in blockchain. Im
              grateful
              to Regina, Kevin, and Sr Labs for sharing their knowledge and insights.
