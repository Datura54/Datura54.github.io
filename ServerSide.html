      <p>First go to the bottom right side of your windows, left-click on the Network Icon then just left
        Click on your network<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230511215409.png" src="Pasted image 20230511215409.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
              alt="Pasted image 20230511215409.png" src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511215409.png"></span><br>
          It will bring you to a page like this click on <em>Change adapter options</em><br>
          <span alt="Pasted image 20230511215529.png" src="Pasted image 20230511215529.png"
            class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                alt="Pasted image 20230511215529.png" src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511215529.png"></span><br>
            You will have a page like this, now you will have to discover which one is the internet (NIC
            "Outside") and the internal (NIC "Internal")<br>
            <span alt="Pasted image 20230511215804.png" src="Pasted image 20230511215804.png"
              class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                  alt="Pasted image 20230511215804.png" src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511215804.png"></span><br>
              For that you will have to see which one has a normal <strong>IP Address </strong> and which got an
              automated ip addressed by the <strong>VM</strong>, to do that you click on one of them, then
              <strong>Details</strong>, here you will analyze by the IP which is which, so on this one, you can see
              it's a strange IP <strong>169.254.77.114</strong> so this is our internal NAT<br>
              <span alt="Pasted image 20230511220032.png" src="Pasted image 20230511220032.png"
                class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                    alt="Pasted image 20230511220032.png" src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511220032.png"></span><br>
                By Association the other one is the <strong>Internet NIC</strong>, which we can confirm here, to make
                everything
                easier change their names to the correspondent NIC (The strange IP=Internal
                NIC; Normal IP=Internet NIC)<br>
                <span alt="Pasted image 20230511220308.png" src="Pasted image 20230511220308.png"
                  class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                      alt="Pasted image 20230511220308.png" src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511220308.png"></span><br>
                  Something like this<br>
                  <span alt="Pasted image 20230511220433.png" src="Pasted image 20230511220433.png"
                    class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                        alt="Pasted image 20230511220433.png"
                        src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511220433.png"></span><br>
                    Now we will change the <strong>Internal NIC IP</strong> (Stange IP), do to that go to
                    <strong>Properties -&gt; (Double click) Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong> it should
                    look like this<br>
                    <span alt="Pasted image 20230511221316.png" src="Pasted image 20230511221316.png"
                      class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                          alt="Pasted image 20230511221316.png"
                          src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511221316.png"></span><br>
                      Now you will have to change to<br>
                      IP Adress: 169.254.77.114<br>
                      Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0<br>
                      Default Gateway: nothing (don't type anything, it's literally nothing)<br>
                      Preferred DNS Server: 172.16.0.1<br>
                      Alternate DNS Server: nothing<br>
                      we will not use a <strong>Default Gateway</strong> because our server will serve as one.<br>
                      we will use the Internal NIC as a DNS server for itself, to do that you could use just the IP
                      address that you addressed a few seconds ago or use a generic IP Address (127.0.0.1) that refers
                      to
                      "myself"<br>
                      <span alt="Pasted image 20230511222250.png" src="Pasted image 20230511222250.png"
                        class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                            alt="Pasted image 20230511222250.png"
                            src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511222250.png"></span>
      </p>

      <p>Now we will change the name of our computer, to do that we will go <strong>Righ click on Windows
          Icon -&gt; System -&gt; Rename This PC</strong>, here<br>
        <span alt="Pasted image 20230511220749.png" src="Pasted image 20230511220749.png"
          class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
              alt="Pasted image 20230511220749.png" src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511220749.png"></span><br>
          I changed to DC (Domain Controller), then just restart<br>
          <span alt="Pasted image 20230511222441.png" src="Pasted image 20230511222441.png"
            class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img
                alt="Pasted image 20230511222441.png" src="lib\media\pasted-image-20230511222441.png"></span><br>
            <a href="#SetupDomain" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#SetupDomain</a><br>
            So now, the NIC is all setup, next we will setup the <strong>Domain / AD DS</strong>, for that go
            to your Server Manager and click on <strong>Add roles and features</strong><br>
            <span alt="Pasted image 20230511222731.png" src="Pasted image 20230511222731.png"
              class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><span class="image fit"><img

              That should have opened a window like this, now you will just hit next <strong>except</strong> on
              the one talk address on the next print<br>
              <span alt="Pasted image 20230511222906.png" src="Pasted image 20230511222906.png"

                So you once you are on <strong>Server Roles</strong> (There's an index on the left) You will select
                the second option <strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong><br>
                <span alt="Pasted image 20230511223008.png" src="Pasted image 20230511223008.png"

                        After you hit close, you will see that you have a notification in the right-up corner. We
                        installed the software but we haven't created the Domain yet, so to do it click on the

                      Now put a password, we might never use it but choose something you will remember like

                    hit next till install<br>

                      After restarting, we will create our </strong>dedicated domain account<strong>, instead
                    of using the built-in one. To do that, </strong>Windows menu -&gt; Windows Administrative Tools

                      Here is the domain that we created earlier, now we will create a dedicated one with the same
                      attributes, so right-click on </strong>mydomain.com<strong> then follow the print. We could talk a
                    lot about </strong>Organizational Units<strong> but for now, think of it as a folder.<br>

                      You can uncheck the little box there, I will just not be annoying when later we delete it<br>

                        It should look like that on the left side, now we will add a new </strong>User<strong><br>

                      You can name it whatever you like, I did like this. On the login name, I put the "a-" to signal
                      this is an Admin<br>

                        just create his password and check the boxes like so, we are checking the third box because we
                        are
                        in a Lab environment so we don't have to be bothered putting passwords<br>

                          You will have something like this, so we now have an account but it's still not an admin one,
                          we

            Here select the <strong>Internet Interface</strong> and hit next (Here you can see that we made
            something wrong as on the internal NIC our IP address is 0.0.0.0, so I had to change the IP address

                now when we connect a client to our <strong>Domain Server</strong> he should be able to access the

                      The address is reserved for you for maybe more than 2 hours, but if you are in a Lab or Home
