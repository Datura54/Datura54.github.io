            As the website was defaced due to a
            successful
            attack by the adversary, it would be helpful to understand better what ended up on the website that caused
            defacement.<br />As an analyst, our first quest could be to figure out the traffic flow that could lead us
            to
            the
            answer to this question. At first I was not being able to decode the method used by the attacker, but once i
            stopped
            assuming that the firewall would block any connections made from the server to any IP Address, then it all
            became
            clear

            <div class="codebox">
              <pre><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400">index</span>=botsv1 src=192.168.250.70 sourcetype=suricata</pre>
            </div><a href=""><img src="images/55-2.png" alt="images/55-2.png" /></a> What is
            interesting
            about the output? Usually, the web servers do not originate the traffic or it should be blocked by a
            Firewall.
            The
            browser or the client would be the source, and the server would be the destination. Here we see three
            external
            IPs
            towards which our web server initiates the outbound traffic. There is a large chunk of traffic going to
            these
            external IP addresses, which could be worth checking.<br /><br />Lets check the destination IPs one by one
            to
            see
            what kind of traffic/communication is being carried out.<br /><br /><strong>
              <h3>Search Query:</h3>

              <div class="codebox">

              </div><a href=""><img src="images/55-3.png" alt="images/55-3.png" /></a>There are
              two
              major
              URL&#39;s used, “/joomla/index.php/component/search/” and “/”. The first is used more times but they are
              just
              POST
              request to our own database and eventhough they had a malicious intent they were not sucessfull. That
              leaves
              us the
              second where we find GET requests, but they were blocked and the files were not stored<br /><br /><a
                href=""><img src="images/55-4.png" alt="images/55-4.png" /></a><br /><br />So we will move to the other
              IP

                where
                this
                jpeg file came from.
