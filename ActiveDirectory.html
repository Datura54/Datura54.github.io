          <h1>Active<br />
            Directory</h1>
          <p>
            In this project, I learned how to setup a Server2019 with Active Directory, automated user
            management using PowerShell scripting, configured RAS/NAT for private network connectivity, and enabled
            secure internet access for clients.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Automated Server Configuration for Private Network Connectivity project aims to streamline the process of
          setting up a Server2019 with a private NAT network and enabling secure internet access for multiple clients.
          By leveraging Active Directory, RAS/NAT configuration, and DHCP, the project automates the server setup and
          user management, making it efficient and user-friendly.
        <p>
        <h3>Active Directory Structure</h3>
        The project begins by deploying a Server2019 and establishing an Active Directory infrastructure. With Active
        Directory in place, an Organizational Unit (OU) is created to organize and manage the users and clients that
        will connect to the server.
        <p>


        <div class="image main"><img src="images/ActiveDirectorySturucture.jpg" alt="" /></div>

        Once the Active Directory is set up, the project enables private network connectivity by configuring a private
        NAT network between the server and the clients. This allows clients to access the internet securely through the
        server. Additionally, Remote Access Service (RAS) is set up to facilitate client connections to the server.</p>
        <h3>PowerShell Script for User Management</h3>
        To simplify user management, a PowerShell script is developed to automate the addition, removal, and maintenance
        of users in bulk. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is utilized to assign unique private IP addresses
        to
        each client dynamically.</p>

        <div class="image main"><img src="images/Powershell.jpg" alt="" /></div>

        With the automated configuration and user management in place, the server can now efficiently address multiple
        users/clients, providing them with a private internet connection. The entire process, for user
        management, is seamlessly automated, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent and reliable connectivity
        for the clients.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        The Active Directory project simplifies the setup and management
        of a private network infrastructure, allowing organizations to efficiently address multiple users/clients while
        ensuring secure internet access. By leveraging Active Directory, RAS/NAT configuration, DHCP, and automation
        through PowerShell scripting, this project enables a streamlined and scalable approach to private network
        connectivity in a user-friendly manner.</p>
