        <h2>Active Directory Setup</h2>

      </header>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This project aims to set up a Server2019 with a private NAT network and enable secure internet access for
        multiple clients.
        By leveraging Active Directory, RAS/NAT configuration, and DHCP, the project automates the server setup and
        user management, making it efficient and user-friendly.
      <p>
      <h3>Active Directory Structure</h3>
      We will begin by deploying a Server2019 and establishing an Active Directory infrastructure. With Active
      Directory in place, an Organizational Unit (OU) is created to organize and manage the users and clients that
      will connect to the server.<p>


      <div class="image main"><img src="images/ActiveDirectorySturucture.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      Once the Active Directory is set up, the project enables private network connectivity by configuring a private
      NAT network between the server and the clients. This allows clients to access the internet securely through the
      server. Additionally, Remote Access Service (RAS) is set up to facilitate client connections to the server. In
      order to assign unique private IP addresses to each client dynamically we will setup DHCP (Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol).</p>
      <h3>PowerShell Script for User Management</h3>
      To simplify user management, a PowerShell script is developed to automate the addition, removal, and maintenance
      of users in a automated way.</p>

      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Powershell.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      With the automated configuration and user management in place, the server can now efficiently address multiple
      users/clients, providing them with a private internet connection. The entire process, for user
      management, is seamlessly automated, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent and reliable connectivity
      for the clients.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      The Active Directory project simplifies the setup and management
      of a private network infrastructure, allowing organizations to efficiently address multiple users/clients while
      ensuring secure internet access. By leveraging Active Directory, RAS/NAT configuration, DHCP, and automation
      through PowerShell scripting, this project enables a streamlined and scalable approach to private network
      connectivity in a user-friendly manner.</p>
