    <h1>Investigate anomalies using Splunk.</h1><br /><br />Tittle: Investigating With Splunk<br /><br /><strong>
      <h2>Scenario Notes:</h2>
    </strong><br />• SOC Analyst Johny noticed anomalous behaviors in Windows machine logs.<br />• Adversary access and
    backdoor creation detected.<br />• Logs pulled from suspected hosts, ingested into Splunk for investigation.<br />•
    Focus on identifying unauthorized access, privilege escalation, unusual network traffic, and
    processes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>
      <h2>Objective:</h2>
    </strong><br />Successfully investigate and identify anomalous behaviors in Windows machine logs to detect and
    mitigate potential security breaches in a real-world scenario.<br /><strong>

      <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    </strong><br />1. A Web Browser Password Viewer was executed on the infected machine, with the binary located at
    &quot;C:\Users\FINANC~1\AppData\Local\Temp\11111.exe&quot;.<br /><br />2. The company name listed in the logs was
    &quot;Nirsoft.&quot;<br /><br />3. Another suspicious binary, &quot;IonicLarge.exe,&quot; was executed from the same
    folder as the previous binary. Its original filename was listed as &quot;PalitExplorer.exe&quot; (format:
    IonicLarge.exe,PalitExplorer.exe).<br /><br />4. The binary &quot;IonicLarge.exe&quot; made two outbound connections
    to the malicious IP address &quot;2[.]56[.]59[.]42&quot;.<br /><br />5. The same binary, &quot;IonicLarge.exe,&quot;
    made changes to the Windows Defender registry key path &quot;HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
    Defender&quot;.<br /><br />6. Two processes were killed, and their associated binaries were deleted. The names of
    the binaries were &quot;phcIAmLJMAIMSa9j9MpgJo1m.exe&quot; and &quot;WvmIOrcfsuILdX6SNwIRmGOJ.exe&quot; (format:
    phcIAmLJMAIMSa9j9MpgJo1m.exe,WvmIOrcfsuILdX6SNwIRmGOJ.exe).<br /><br />7. The attacker ran several commands within a
    PowerShell session to change Windows Defender&#39;s behavior. The last executed command was &quot;powershell WMIC
    /NAMESPACE:\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender PATH MSFT_MpPreference call Add ThreatIDDefaultAction_Ids=2147737394
    ThreatIDDefaultAction_Actions=6 Force=True&quot;.<br /><br />8. The attacker set four IDs in chronological order of
    execution: 2147735503, 2147737010, 2147737007, 2147737394 <br /><br />9. Another malicious binary,
    &quot;EasyCalc.exe,&quot; was executed on the infected workstation from the location
    &quot;C:\Users\Finance01\AppData\Roaming\EasyCalc\EasyCalc.exe&quot;.<br /><br />10. The DLLs loaded from the
    &quot;EasyCalc.exe&quot; binary were &quot;ffmpeg.dll,&quot; &quot;nw.dll,&quot; and &quot;nw_elf.dll&quot;
