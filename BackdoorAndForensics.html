        <h2>Backdoor Detection and Remediation</h2>
      </header>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>

        In this project, we uncover and analyze an unauthorized backdoor that has been created on a computer system. The
        objective is to demonstrate the potential risks associated with such backdoors and showcase the steps involved
        in detecting and mitigating them.


        First let's find what is the net cat executable. </p>
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      I'm gonna copy that net cat executable to here.
      The copy command will not show any output so to see if everything went ok, we can
      use the command ls to display every file in the reposotorie we are in
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      Now we will create a backdoor by executing, to the background, the file we have created (which in this case is
      basicly the netcar executable)
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/3.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      In order to see the process running we can the command list all files, with the filters to only show internet
      based processes and to do not try to assume which protocol is in use in that port, meaning he will directly show
      me what is the port number, not what might be the protocol in use (lsof -i -P)
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      Now is were the real fun beggins.
      We will remove the file we have created with the copy of the netcat executable and will check if after the file
      is removed if the process has stopped or not in use, to do that we will remove notEvil (rm notEvil)
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/5.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      Now that we have removed our file, is his process still running? Let's check out!
      For that we will use once again the command (lsof -i -P)
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/6.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      The process is still running!! This means that currenctly we have a deleted file running on this machine!</p> Lets
      confirm that the backdoor is running you can see that the lsof command also says what the port is doing, so now
      the port is listenning/waiting for a connection, so let's make it by using the command netcat on our computer
      machine on the port assigned, on an user other then root(nc 172.28.52.14 2222).</p>

      We could also use 127.0.0.1 as IP because we are already on the computer we want but want to escalate our
      privilegies. After connecting you can
      see that we are in the same directory as we were before, because the files are the same, but just to confirm we
      can run whoami, to confirm whoami, and we will see that we are root. That means that our backdoor works and now
      we can give any user the privelegies a root user has.
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/7.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      If you remember lsof command tells us what the port is doing, so, is did the port status changed? Let's check it
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/8.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      It did, it show us that there is another user (adhd) is connected from the port 34190 to root trough the port
      2222.
      This can be no good for the Forensics Teams so what would they do?</p>
      Firstly lets look at their perspective to know what would be their best step. So, we have found that there was
      in the past an attacker that created a file in our system, executed a backdoor and tried to hide their steps in
      order to us not be able to reverse engineer their steps. So... What do we do? We can use the command (lsof +L1) to
      show us every file that is still executing in our computer system
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/9.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      This shows us that the file is still running on memory even though we deleted him from the operating system.
      (When you hit delete or throw to thrash a file you do not delete it from the memory but you break the link that
      connect the operating system to the memory).</p>

      So in order to retrieve the information from the memory and relink or link that file memory to another in the
      operating system we first go to the proc depositorie and run (strings ./exe)
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/10.jpg" alt="" /></div>

      That will output the file we wanted from memory that was previously deleted, i tried to show a bit of the
      output, it's much bigger then what i can show u can use (| less) to view the output of a command or file one page
      at a time. It provides scrolling and searching capabilities for easier reading.
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/11.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      But how do we end the promiscuous file?!?! That is actually quite easy, you just need to find the PID of the
      process, how do you find the PID process? You can find it by using (ps aux) or (lsof -i -P) in this case the PID
      is 501, so we will just do (kill 501)
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/12.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      And it's dead, does the other user still has access?
      <div class="image main"><img src="images/Backdoor/13.jpg" alt="" /></div>
      Nop, as soon as i typed ls he just kicked me and i returned to the previous user.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      By following these steps, the project demonstrates the existence of an unauthorized backdoor, its potential
      persistence in memory even after file deletion, and the process of detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such
      backdoors. The title of the project could be "Unauthorized Backdoor Detection and Remediation: Uncovering,
      Analyzing, and Securing Systems."
