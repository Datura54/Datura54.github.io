        <h2>ZAP Attack</h2>
      </header>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>From December 14 - 17, 2020, John Strand from Black Hills Information Security taught a 16-hour course spanning
        4 days called "SOC Core Skills". The class is based on foundational skills that John thinks all security
        analysts should have, and in fact, are skills that he expects out of analysts that work for him at BHIS.


        If you've come across this post and you haven't attended a BHIS online course yet, you can read about that
        experience HERE with some nuggets of useful information that may help you should you decide to attend one in the
        future. Even though this post is about a different course, all the same ideas still apply.


        SOC Core Skills covered the following security topics:

        Core networking skills

        Live Windows Forensics

        Live Linux Forensics

        Memory Forensics

        Active Directory Analysis

        Network Threat Hunting

        Basics of Vulnerability Management

        The Incident Response Process

        What's great about John's "Pay What You Want" courses (other than paying what you want for a $495 course) is the
        fact that all the topics had an associated practical lab to go along with it. In fact, we completed a total of
        10 labs as part of this course. As I have done with my previous posts, I will post the links to my write-ups for
        each of the labs at the end of this post.



        SOC Core Skills with John Strand

        This course is the 2nd installment of what will soon be a trifecta of introductory security courses created by
        John Strand. The first one is "Getting Started in Security with BHIS & MITRE ATT&CK". John also has a third
        installment called "Active Defense and Cyber Deception". The class is currently open for registration now and is
        scheduled for March of 2021. You can get a taste of what it will be like from his previous work on the same
        subject.


        As an aspiring Security Analyst, I ate up every piece of this class. Some of it was overlap with the Intro to
        Security course, but that is to be expected since a SOC Analyst is considered an entry-level role. If I was
        currently working as a SOC Analyst, I feel like I would be able to put many of the lessons taught in this course
        to good use in the real-world, and many people who took the course and are in that position said likewise.


        I had some hands-on time with DeepBlueCLI, Windows Event Viewer, WireShark, ZAP, DVWA, TCPDump, Volatility, and
        a lot of Linux and Windows CLI. Other tools like RITA and Nessus had reports we were able to analyze, but no
        actual hands-on practical. I've mentioned this before, but my favorite part about these labs is how John ties
        each one back to being a defensive minded blue teamer. We were able to see what attacks like a password spray
        and a reverse shell would look like and fairly simple things we can do in our environment to remediate those
        exploits. And the lessons could apply to anyone in any environment because the labs were predominately based on
        open-source tools if not available outright from the Microsoft Suite.

        John revamped the Virtual Machine he creates for his courses. He even came up with a super cool way to update
        his lab procedures and index on the fly via a GitHub script. This VM is now a part of my own home lab
        environment, and it allows me to practice what I learned at any time. The single best part about this VM is the
        fact that I can perform red and blue tactics on the SAME VM which is critical to those who don't have the time,
        funds, or knowledge to build out a traditional home lab infrastructure.


        My biggest takeaway from this course was actually a broad statement made by John where he said it is better to
        illustrate an Incident Response event as Legos rather than a Flowchart because the idea of Legos is more
        flexible with the type of possible scenarios that are likely to happen whereas a Flowchart model doesn't give
        any flexibility or leeway on what needs to be done if the event doesn't follow the rigid structure of a
        flowchart. In this way, it provides a quicker and more deliberate response by defenders.


        The funniest moment of the course was the argument of text editors! John summed it up as such:

        People who use vi are ninjas (they're stealthy and only carry what they need).

        People who use emacs are pirates (they have tools for everything to be prepared for anything).

        People who use nano just woke up and hit their head getting out of bed ('nuff said).

        After the class, I went through all the labs again. Since I'm not currently a cybersecurity professional, it is
        up to me to practice and become as proficient as I can. Performing the labs over again and creating write-ups
        for each one helps me retain knowledge. It also gives me a resource to look back to if I come across something
        similar in the future and need to refresh my memory. Feel free to click on the link below to view my write-ups.


        I want to end this post by giving a huge shout out and thanks to John Strand, the Interlude Intruders (aka
        Cracker Chat), and everyone at BHIS for hosting another fantastic event. Until the next one. . .</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      The Active Directory project simplifies the setup and management
      of a private network infrastructure, allowing organizations to efficiently address multiple users/clients while
      ensuring secure internet access. By leveraging Active Directory, RAS/NAT configuration, DHCP, and automation
      through PowerShell scripting, this project enables a streamlined and scalable approach to private network
      connectivity in a user-friendly manner.</p>
