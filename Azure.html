        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project aims to create a virtual machine
          honeypot in Azure, which will be exposed to the internet, intentionally making it an attractive target for
          hackers. By monitoring and analyzing their activities, the project seeks to gain insights into cyber threats
          and their geographical origins.
        <p>

        <h3>Honeypot Diagram</h3>

        We will begin by setting up a virtual machine in Azure and configuring it as a honeypot. All ports of the
        virtual machine are opened to the internet, allowing hackers to easily find and attempt to compromise the
        machine. The firewall is deliberately disabled to ensure that hackers are not blocked by it, thus maximizing
        their attempts.</p>
        <div class="image main"><img src="images/honeyPotDiagram.jpg" alt="" /></div>

        <h3>IP Geolocation</h3>

        When a hacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the honeypot through a failed RDP connection, an error
        is logged in the Event Viewer of the virtual machine. This action triggers an automated PowerShell script,
        which extracts the IP address of the attacker from the Event Viewer logs. To determine the real geolocation of
        the attacker, a third-party API is utilized. The IP address is sent to the API, which returns the latitude,
        longitude, country, and state information of the attacker.</p>

        <div class="image main"><img src="images/azure powershell.png" alt="" /></div>
        <h3>KQL-Azure Query</h3>

        The gathered geolocation data, including latitude, longitude, country, and state, is then saved to a file for
        further processing. Returning to Azure, a Query based on KQL (Azure Query Language) is created to process the
        information in the file. This query filters and organizes the data, extracting only the necessary details for
        visualization.</p>

        <div class="image main"><img src="images/KQLjpg.jpg" alt="" /></div>
        <h3>World Map</h3>

        Once the query is executed, the project generates a world map that visually represents the geographical
        locations of hackers attempting to brute force the honeypot. Each hacker's location is pinpointed on the map
        using their latitude and longitude coordinates, and additional information such as country/state is displayed.
        This interactive map provides a global view of cyber threats, enabling better understanding and analysis of
        the geographic distribution of attacks.</p>

        <div class="image main"><img src="images/rdp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        The Azure Sentinel Map project offered a unique opportunity to improve my skills on cyber threats, allowing me
        to protect an organization by combining
        Azure cloud services, honeypot techniques, event logging, third-party APIs, and data visualization. It not
        only enhanced my skills but also was a really fun and gratefying project to do.</p>
